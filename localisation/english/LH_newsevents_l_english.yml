 LH_news.3.d:0 "The Movement started out as a counter Movement to the pro-nazi stance of our government and against the discriminatory nature of the current laws adressing the minorities. Though the tribal-Hungarians are still clearly superior to the minorities - which is explained by the fact that Hungary is the home of the Hungarian - there should be no discrimination against non-tribal People. Our journalist friends have already started publishing their magazines with the name "The Dragon", in which they demanded a static quota of tribal-Hungarians in office and the protection of tribal-Hungarian farmers. Another important point of the newspaper is that if the first and second jew law restricted the rights of Jews in Hungary, then there should also be a law restricting arian rights in Hungary, since they, just like the Jews, are not Hungarians. Since this is hardly possible, they demand a nullification of all the Jew laws. "
