 POLITICS_MIKLOS_HORTHY_DESC:0 "A former naval commander of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Horthy Miklós stopped the continuous revolutions after the Great war and came to power as the Regent of Hungary in 1921 and is holding that office until today. While he was only meant to be a temporary head of state until a king could be chosen for the country, the situation proved itself to be more complicated, resulting in him staying regent for more than 10 years now. Many hope for him to stay in power, since Hungary's situation has only gotten better during his reign. Only time can tell what fate has in store for him."
