 LH_GER.2.d:0 "The Hungarians have approached us with a request that we help them in their task of recovering the Economy. Agreeing to such terms would not bring us any short term benefits, but they will definitely be more reliant on us, allowing for an aligment in the future."

 LH_ROM.1.t:0 "The Antonescu Compromise"
 LH_ROM.1.d:0 "The recent change of ownership in the northern transylvanian mountains have caused quite some uproar within the population. People call for a strong leader to take a firm hand and restore [ROOT.GetNameDef] to its former size and glory. [ROOT.GetLeader] has adressed the public in a radio broadcast and on speeches in the capital. Confindent that Romania will find a sufficient solution to this problem, he emphasized that whatever would happen, we would be the winners. Two options were presented to the listeners, of which [HUN.GetNameDef] will play a decisive role. \n\nThe first option - which was obviously preferred by the public, judging by its reaction - was to forcively take back Northern Transylvania from the Hungarians, once the time is right and they aren't backed by the Germans. [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided, that he would accept an alternative to it. Since Transylvania had been a highly disputed territory between us and the Hungarians for hundreds of years, it might be better to agree to a middle ground. The Hungarians will be presented with a deal, in which Romania renounces its claims in Northern Transylvania. In exchange, the Hungarians must renounce their claims in southern Transylvania. In addition to this, both parties will sign a pact of non-agression to further strengthen this anti-war stance. \n\nIf they are willing to agree to these terms, we might be able to relinquish the hatred between our countries for good, and it may be the beginning of a new friendship between our nations."

 LH.2.t:0 "The Yugoslavian Docks"
 LH.2.d:0 "With our conquest of Yugoslavia complete, it is finally time to honour the agreement of article 3 of the Rome Protocols. The plans for the expansion of the docks in the adriatic sea have already been made prior to the invasion, and the construction of these facilities are already under way. The territory of Yugoslavia is to be divided according to the article and with it, we will finally have our access to the sea back. \n\nKeeping up the flow of trade through these ports will drastically strengthen our economy, and help our country in the long run in other underdeveloped areas, while also satisfying the nation in their need for returning to our old, ancient borders."
 LH.2.a:0 "We grow stronger by each day." 
 LH.1.t:0 "The [GetYear] M.O.V.E Convention"
 LH.1.d:0 "The leaders of the M.O.V.E have yet again arranged a convention, inviting all influencial politicians and former soldiers to join in Budapest to discuss the future of the organisation. This meeting has become especially important to the organisation, as their name (Hungarian National Defense Association) has dedicated their existance to keeping the internal stability of the nation. The Scythe Cross nuisance, led by Zoltán Böszörmény, has painfully proven that the country needs the M.O.V.E now more than ever. \nInternally, many believe that the M.O.V.E. will be banned, as [HUN_miklos_horthy.GetName] is not very fond of its activities due to its fascist nature. \n\nAfter the opening speech, the convention had war veterans hold speeches about the Great War and the future of Hungary. Others spoke about how the M.O.V.E could and should be a more organized group, even hinting a possible power takeover in the upcoming years, as soon as the political situation gets more tense. \nAll in all, the convention itself was peaceful, and as the suggestions made by some visitors about how to improve on the organisation was discussed, a man in the back row stood up, shouting "Long Live the Rongyos Gárda!" \n\nAs scandallous as it may have seemed, the action caused for more and more people to stand up and join the shouting. It turned out that the most known members of the Rongyos Gárda had been present at the convention, as listeners. The M.O.V.E has no problem with the Rongyos Gárda, but it seems the people are starting to see the two groups as opposites. It is very true that the views of the two groups differ substantially, and it seems the people are polarized, which is why we need to make a clear statement as to which side we are backing. \nThe situation escalated, as the M.O.V.E supporters started silencing the Rongyos supporters, and the convention was on the vurge of collapsing into an infight."
 LH.1.a:0 "Arrest the Rongyos Supporters!"
 LH.1.b:0 "The Rongyos Gárda is the future!"
 LH.3.t:0 "An interesting Proposal"
 LH.3.d:0 "Our allies have approached us with a proposal: Should we want it, they would be ready to back us in claiming back what used to be in the Austrian Sphere, namely Bavaria and other smaller states in its west. We now have the choice to send Germany an ultimatum, demanding the return of these territories or we could politely decline."

 LH.5.d:0 "The foolish Germans have underestimated our military strength. [FROM.GetLeader] has promptly refused our ultimatum without even giving it any second thoughts.

 LH.9.t:0 "Historical or not?"
 LH.9.d:0 "This mod offers you the unique experience of going through the exact historical events that Hungary went through. In order for this to work, you will have no choice over prime ministers and political events, as the politicians in those days were also heavily bound to Germany with their political abilities. Therefore, I have added a "Historical" filter in the focus preview to help you guide through the focus tree. Of course, some freedom can be taken, but if you stray too far away from the historical focuses, the events will not happen in the correct order. If you choose that you want to play historical, some focuses will be locked. Don't worry, this is intended, as it stops bugs from happening. \n\nIn order to start the process, you will need to go down the neutral Regency path, and when the first event pops up to choose the prime minister, you will need to select §RKálmán Darányi§!. After that, the event chain for the historical game will be set in motion. So, lean back and enjoy the ride!"

 LH.12.d:0 "The modern war has shifted its frontlines not only on the ground, but in the air.

For this reason, the fourth Phase of the Program has been drafted and our engineers can soon get to work."

 LH.8.d:0 "Not long ago, Hungary - as part of Austria Hungary - had its own navy, which had quite some success in the Adriatic. By regaining a shoreline we can make us of the old shipbuilding companies, which have now been newly established, due to the next phase of the Györi Program."

 LH.15.desc:0 "In a tense meeting with [YUG.GetLeader], our delegation was told that the sovereignty of Croatia was not up for discussion, and that in any event the [YUG.GetAdjective] government would never bow to such pressure. The people of the Croatia had their say in 1919, and they choose to stay with [YUG.GetNameDefDef]. As far as the [YUG.GetAdjective] government is concerned, that is the end of the matter."
 LH.15.a:0 "Perhaps it is."

 LH.16.t:0 "Welcome to the Expanded Hungary Mod!"
 LH.16.desc:0 "This Mod aims to give you better immersion and tries to depict a far more accurate history than in the base game. Paradox has made a lot of mistakes when it comes to the history and politics of Hungary. There are so many opportunities and variety in terms of alternative scenarios and possibilites that could be explored, yet aren't in the base game (Maybe due to language issues at Paradox?) After the what I call success of my first mod (Little Hungary) , I decided to start a new one together with MDavid. We collected tons of ideas and he provided me with minister design companies GFX. Since the initial start I have fully taken over the project and am now working on it alone. All GFX has been redrawn and redesigned to give the mod a unique look and flair. This includes new advisors, ideas and portraits for generals and leaders. \n\nWhat awaits me in this mod? \n\nYou will be faced with choosing one of the main four ideologies, which will then lead you through various sub-branches of the focus tree. One the one hand, you will have to deal with the Red Terror that still plagues the hungarian countryside and on the other deal with internal political issues, power struggles and births of new parties and their ideological goals. Will you give in to German pressure or will you be able to withstand it? Will you manage to steer Hungary through the second world war period without being on the losers side? Will you be able to reclaim, and keep the old territories of Greater Hungary? Or will you go a completely different direction and embrace communism? \n\nI hope you enjoy this mod and I thank you for subscribing to it! Have fun! \n\n§RPlease note that when choosing the first political focus, the focus tree will collapse into its relevant part. This is due to the size of the focus tree to make it easer to keep the overview. Choose your first focus wisely..."

While his views where very controversial and clearly fascist, we now find ourselves at the crossroads of appointing a new prime minister. By choosing wisely, [ROOT.GetLeader] can designate a new Prime Minister who then can form a new government and thus a change in political direction. This opportunity could shape the coming years and our path in the upcoming struggle. \n\nWe can either appoint Kálmán Darányi, Gömbös' "legitimate" predecessor, the great consolidator István Bethlen, or József Széll, a close associate of Darányis with a more moderate view on politics. There is also the possibility of designating Béla Imrédy, who is currently working on an idea called the "Györi Program" or the national socialist trouble maker Ferenc Szálasi with his hungarist ideas. Both Károly Peyer and Árpád Szakasits are lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right time for a comeback and lead the nation back to democracy. If we are heading for this, we should definitely choose one of the two.

Reports have reached us, that Gyula Gömbös has suprisingly died of cancer while on a business trip in Germany. The position of prime minister is yet to be announced, but whoever it will be - or not be - will surely not have the same amount of influence and power as Gömbös had.

After being prime minister for such a short time, Peidl resigned and Károly Peyer took over the leadership of the Szóciáldemokrata Párt (MSZDP). Inviting him to be Prime Minister could therefore bring back the idea of a democratic Hungary. \n\n Árpád Szakasits, on the other hand, was an active contributor of said communist revolution, for which his father was sentenced to death and him to prison in the aftermath. Since 1927 he has been the secretary of the MSZDP and since 1928 the President of the Hungarian National Federation of Construction Workers (MÉMOSZ). Being with one foot in social democracy and with the other in communism, he is surely a good candidate to unite the two fronts. \n Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky is a very peculiar and controvesial character in national politics.

The time was not yet right. \n\nIn October of the same year, Karl arrived with his wife in Sopron to once again claim his right to the throne. Loyal legitimists gathered a military force and because the telegram of the Kaisers arrival came to late, the march to Budapest was delayed and Horthy could use the military to fend them off. 19 People died that day and Karl aborted his mission with the explanation that he did not want more innocent Hungarian lives to be wasted. A civil war was imminent and Karl did not want to risk it. He was then exiled in Madeira, when he died of Tuberculosis not long after. \n\nHis son, Otto von Habsburg is thus the next Habsburg heir to the hungarian throne. However, in November of 1921 the hungarian government - pressured by the members of the little entente - officially deprived the Habsburgs of their right to the throne and we now face the consequences of this act. In order to officially restore the Habsburg monarchy, this law needs to be repealed. This said law was the subject of the recent discussion in parliament, and the news of inviting a Habsburg back has quickly reached the public. Divided opinions have led to various protests against the Habsburg prince. One particular protest descended into violence and we now face a similar situation as in 1921. It is up to us to decide if we really want to push the Habsburg claim or forget the idea of the Austro-Hungarian Empire once and for all and instate a different monarch, heading to the dream of Greater Hungary. \n\nFor this, we could utilize the "Free Royal Electors", a monarchist group supporting the idea of restoring the monarchy but refusing Charles IV.'s right to the throne and with him all of the Habsburgs. Instead, they demand for a hungarian king, who should restore the kingdom to its "pre-Habsburg" state. Voices within the Free Royal Electors have been calling for the regent, [ROOT.GetLeader] to assume control of the crown, while others favor his son, István.

The tense situation has caused for more and more to stand up and take matters in their own hands, and the situation on the streets is now civil war-like. \n\nThe local police stations are overburdened with the task of keeping the peace, which is why we should consider sending in the army.

We will have to address this issue in the future, in order to stand united and strong when the time comes that we need it the most. \n\nWe have been presented by three possible options on how to handle the issue: the first one involves supressing the various nations, moving our capital back to Vienna and reform the Austrian absolutism. The other option is to try and recreate Dualism or even Trialism. This would benefit the two or three nations, but at the cost of loosing some power. The third option would be to realise Kaiser Karls dream and form a sort of Confederation of all nations. This would please the various nations, though it does come with a high cost of loosing a lot of power to the people and restricting our monarchs power and abilities to handle. We must choose our path wisely."

Having gained his diploma in Hungary and his mother being a hungarian who is a direct descendant of the ancient house of the Árpáds, Albrecht sees himself as a Hungarian and is also active in present day politics as a member in one of the various fascist parties.

By limiting some parts of public rights we can ensure an empire loyal to traditional values, which makes us both susceptile to both western democratic and traditional semi-autocratic monarchist ways, allowing for high flexibility in terms of foreign policy.

However, the country found itself without its valuable natural ressources, factories and their means of agricultural production. The country was in risk of famine and collapse. Luckily, the situation has gotten better since and with the world slowly getting out of balance, we might have a chance of getting some territoy back. Ever since the Treaty of Trianon, the nation's people have had hope of a possible revision of the provinces, which they thought where rightfully Hungary's. The time has come where we can act, and punish those that took from us and dragged us through the mud. \n\nBecause the idea of the Revision has no clear definition in terms of how the borders should really look, it is up to us to decide. Many ethnic hungarians live around the actual borders, and the further you go, the less hungarians you find. Historically, the Kingdom of Croatia was a part of our nation. It is not entirely necessary to reconquer it, if we don't want to, since the amount of ethnic Hungarians is just so low, the people are slowly giving up on that idea... \n\nIn essence, we will have the choice to stop or carry on with the Revision multiple times. The first time, we can stop after regaining Southern Slovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia, Northern Transylvania and the Vojvodina, since these are the areas with the most ethnic Hungarians. However, we can continue the Revision until we unify the carpathian basin, which is also our rightful claim, though the amount of actual hungarians in northern slovakia and Southern Transylvania is pretty low and cause us issues... The last option would be to carry on with the Revision until we control the entirety of the former Kingdom, including Croatia. While this route will give us the most bonuses, it will also be the most difficult, and failing the revision could lead to us loosing everything we managed to take back... Keep in mind that the Revision events after taking Southern Slovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia, Northern Transylvania and Vojvodina will only continue once all of Slovakia and Transylvania has been conquered!\n\nThe big question therefore is; Do we really want Croatia? \n\n §REncouraging Immigration from outside the current borders will prevent us from coring territory through Revision!§!"

The huge success of the government has lead to a spike in votes in favour of them, guaranteeing political stability for the next decade. Finally having achieved its great dream, Hungary must now face other problems linked to the Revision: The ethnic minorities within the country.

This huge shock not only struck the economy and caused political instability, but also caused nationalist sentiments to spread among the population within and outside of the new country. \nMore than a decade has passed and the people living outside of Hungary still clamor for the return of the old borders. However, the world situation might not allow this to happen. We might be able to regain some of the lost territories, but we might have to face the reality of things: It is true that a lot of the lost territories contained hungarians as a minority, not as a majority. \nTherefore, the ministry of interior has formulated a plan together with the foreign ministry. It states the encouragement of reallocating hungarian minorities from across the border back into the country. While this would result in a lot of costs, it most certainly would result in a much higher population and therefore a higher amount of soldiers we can draft into the army. Ironically - should we go to war - these soldiers will be the ones helping to regain the territories we evacuated them from. \nInviting a vast amount of people in our country will give us new challenges, however. We will need to expand the housing in our country so that everyone has a place to live. This could come at high industrial costs, so we should evaluate, if it is worth it. \n\nAnother aspect we should consider, is the loss of diplomatic reputation that would follow from this plan. Though we would gain more soldiers and population, it would mean a loss of able-bodied men for our neighbouring countries, who will not take this action lightly... If we do not want to risk a war, we should sign treaties with the other nations, where we renounce our claims on their territory in exchange for the population...

In 1934, the three leaders Meskó, Pálffy and Festetics made the first step in uniting the parties by signing an alliance. This, however, did not last very long and Festetics went to create a new fascist party with István Balogh, a catholic priest. \n\nThe only one remaining capable of fusing the parties into one is Ferenc Szálasi. His charisma and talent for speech often reminds his listeners of Adolf Hitler, which has secured him a lot of followers all around the parties.

This would for one be a token statement, proving our long lasted Polish-Hungarian friendship, while also signalling and upsetting the Germans that we have no intentions to join them in their madness of war in the near future. \n\nOn the other hand, we could ignore these people at our border, not letting them in, until the Germans arrive from the West, allowing them to decide what to do with the refuge-seeking Poles. While this would not be seen as any insult to the Poles, since it is not our obligation to help, the Germans would see it as an act of friendship and loyalty and could lead to closer ties with them, leading to an increase of their political influence in our country.

It contains a proposal which was written by [FROM.GetLeader] personally and is surprisingly adressed 'To all the people living in the Great Nation of Hungary'. It seems Germany's recent intervention now known as the Second Vienna Award, has changed Romanias view of us. The proposal states a personal idea of [FROM.GetLeader], in which Hungarians and Romanians alike can live in harmony and peace with eachother. The Romanians are tired of the constant fight over Transylvania and have come to the conclusion that it would be best for them to stop the fighting and bickering and instead share the contested territory. \n\nThe proposal states, that Romania will forever give up its claims on Northern Transylvania and officially acknowledge it as a sovereign part of [ROOT.GetNameDef]. In return, they ask us to for ever relinquish our claims on Southern Transylvania. In addition to this, both parties will sign a pact of non-agression, as a sign of good will.\nThe Romanians have already once promised to "forever give up Transylvania" in the middle ages, just to stab us in the back and take it from us a few years later... We can hope that the Romanians are more civilized than then, and we could sign the Deal. Accepting would mean giving up on Greater Hungary spanning the Carpathian Basin, but could allow for a strong alliance between our countries, in case things turn sour with Germany. It is definitely worth the thought. \n\nOn the other hand, it is a very peculiar change of heart, since the Romanians have been stout defenders of Transylvania since the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It might be a sign of weakness, which we could exploit - it might be the right time to strike and secure the entirity of Transylvania. \nAs this situation can be seen as a sign of Romanian weakness, it could also potentially be the first steps to finally reconcile with them and freshly start an era of friendship."

While this is clearly a highly controversial topic for the nations surrounding Hungary, it would mainly serve their national pride, if we agreed.

A historic days are waiting for our nation, which will hopefully be remembered as the days we finally achieve our dream of a united Hungary."

After an opening ceremony, where the British chairman of the congress welcomed the Hungarian envoys with a speech about Hungarian-British friendship, followed by some moving words of our envoy, István Bethlen, the congress was officially opened and the diplomats finally started the negotiations at the table. \nThe event got full attention by the Hungarian, as well as British media, as the entirety of the negotiations was filmed and broadcasted on national television. \n\nAs the noise settled and everyone was seated, the negotiations were initiated by the first proposal of the congress. Our experts have prepared three main territorial wishes, which we can choose to speak and negotiate about.\n\nFor one, there is the problem of Northern Transylvania, a very difficult topic, seeing as the Romanians wont give up their territory easily. Another topic would be the lands in Slovakia, which have a Hungarian majority. And lastly; the Vojvodina, or "Délvidék", as the Hungarians call it, is a melting pot of Serbian and Hungarian culture."

Seeing as the majority of the Population, especially in "Székelyföld", the tip of Northern Transylvania in the mountains, is completely inhabited by the Széklers, it is not a surprise the Hungarians whish to return this peace of land to their nation. \n\nWhile we do see the unfairness in how things have developed there, we do not know if it is a wise decision to ask the Romanians to give up their territory. It could either lead to their isolation, or to closening our relations, so ultimately we will have to decide what we want. It is to be considered, that Bessarabia is claimed by the Soviets, and having the Romanians in our faction could potentially lead to a war with Russia, which we definitely do not want or need. If we allow the Hungarians to acquire the territory, we will need to compensate the Romanians by allowing them in our faction. This will come at a cost for Hungary. But that will be discussed at the end of the Congress. For now, we need to decide wether to give Hungary the territory or not."

 LH.215.d:0 "Even our best experts couldn't do the job: Britain did not see the injustice of Transylvania and we could not persuade anyone of our cause.

 LH.216.t:0 "The Discussion of Slovak Lands"
 LH.216.d:0 "The London Congress is in full swing and one of the Hungarian diplomats has brought up the case of Southern Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Southern Slovakia is mainly inhabited by Ethnic Hungarians and while Carpathian Ruthenia has no Hungarian majority, it is still a region of vital Hungarian influence and has been for centuries. Furthermore, it was presented that the Germans have claims on Czechoslovakia, and by securing these regions for Hungary, it would at least deny the Germans some lands, as they would never ask for land from a member state of the Allies. \n\nIt will be difficult to convince Czechoslovakia however, that they should give up the land and it could ultimately lead to a war, but when is that ever out of the question? The Hungarian envoys are right, however: The Fate of Czechoslovakia is short lived, as the Germans are very aggressively expanding their borders and are greedily looking at the Czechs, ready to strike at any time. If we help the Hungarians, they would definitely be a stronger ally when the time comes to face the Germans."

 LH.219.d:0 "The London Congress is in full swing and one of the Hungarian diplomats has brought up the case of the Vojvodina and Prekmurje. The Region of Vojvodina, or as the Hungarians call it 'Délvidék', has a Hungarian Majority and consists of the land between the Tisza and the Danuba rivers, which merge near Novi Sad. It is a region of high historical value for the Hungarians, as the area was the place of various battles in the middle ages, mainly against the Ottoman invaders. Since Yugoslavia is mainly controlled by the Serbian politics, the land will be difficult to take from them, since its a core part of the Serbian lands within Yugoslavia. Additionally, Italy holds claims along the coast of Dalmatia and Zadar, which we could use as an advantage, but it could also prove a problem. If we manage to secure Vojvodina for the Hungarians, and have Yugoslavia enter the Allies, Italy's hunger for Dalmatia might take over and they might cause a war, which we really don't need. \n\nPrekmurje However is a very small territory, being the lands north of the Mura within Slovakian territory. However, it is very true that the population there mainly consists of ethnic Hungarians. We might be able to strike a deal with Yugoslavia which is not as... Demanding as asking for the Vojvodina and secure Prekmurje for the Hungarians. \nWe could of course ask for all the territories and risk a war. The choice is ours."

Our experts, politicians, diplomats and other envoys have done their best and we could luckily win the support of Britain for at least some of our lost territories. The excitement within the country is high and people are eagerly awaiting to return to some of the lost territories. \n\nHowever, there still is the matter of payment. The Brits have expressed on multiple occasions during the Congress, that Hungary will have to pay in some way or another for their support. We might be in the same faction as them, but that does'nt mean that they will help for free. \nWith the arrival of our envoys, we have also received an offer of how and what to pay the British. They demand we subjugate ourselves to them, making us a puppet state. However, it is noted that we are permitted to exclusive rights and may become a souverain nation in the future. Additionally, we will need to cleanse the country of extremists and deliver monthly payments to the Brits for a year. \n\nIt is now entirely up to us to comply with these demands, or turn them down. However, turning them down would render the London Congress a failure, since the promised territories will not be transfered back to us. \nOne should also keep in mind, that signing this contract does not mean that we will receive the territories for certain, and not without bloodshed. Our various neighbours will all receive an offer by the British, should we accept, and it will be up to them to cede the territory or not. The Brits are not likely to want a war in this region so the fate of the territories lie upon the response of our neighbours. Should [ROOT.GetLeader] sign the contract?"

It seems that all odds are stacked against us, and not even our allies see the injustice that was put up against us so many years ago. Either we are simply not meant to have any of our territories back, maybe we are too stubborn to see that the world has changed and we should accept the fact that Hungary is and will always be the way it is today. \n\nRelations between our countries have soured, and nobody knows for sure how long this alliance will last, since the people of Hungary feel betrayed by the lack of empathy for them. The grave problems of the failure of the London Congress has already started flourishing in our country, with nationalistic movements starting to grow from the depths of society like weeds in a garden. If we are not carefull, we might even be forced to face a civil war, since the whole action in London has been justified as the incapability of the current government.

These people work in factories, have no education due to the lack of free education, work long hours for low payment and have no means of standing up for their rights, in fear of loosing income to keep their families alive. If we are to stop our society from falling apart, we need to start from the bottom and make the lives of these workers easier to benefit the whole nation in the long run. \n\nOn the other hand are the smallholders and small business owners. While this group already enjoys quite some privileges, given to them in the years of Bethlens Consolidation, their life quality has decreased in the past few years. Smallholders cannot keep up with the rising expenses for their land, and failed harvest only brings them more debt. Business owners dont have an easy time either, with the current economical crisis heavily affecting their income and possibility to keep their business going. Helping this class might even bring us some profit that would otherwise be lost. \n\nIt is our choice as to which side we choose to support.

The working class were able to display all their might. The situation was on the brink of escalation and it nearly turned into a revolution. The communist party has been celebrating this historical day, together with the 1919 revolution ever since. It showed everyone that with determination and organisation, the proletariat is well capable of standing up for itself. \n\nIf we want to take full control of the nation, we will need every support we can get.

One of these design issues is its yaw stability, which was very poor, often causing it to sideslip when flying on low altitudes.

However, though he is the legitimate heir to the throne, he is not very popular amongst those who want a Habsburg Hungary. \nWe have two other viable candidates, who have a strong claim to the throne: On the one hand Archduke Joseph August Viktor Klemens Maria von Habsburg, who currently is the only one to hold the highest rank in our military, and a descendant of Archduke Joseph, who founded the hungarian side of the Habsburg family in the 19th century. We know that he is a good leader, since he was Regent of Hungary for a brief period in 1921, after the first communist republic collapsed. \nOn the other hand there is Archduke Albrecht Franz Joseph Karl Friedrich Georg Hubert Maria of Habsburg-Teschen, or short Ablrecht II., who'se claim to the throne was voiced by his mother as early as in 1923. Ever since the anti-communist counter-revolution, he has been active in parliament, showing an increasing preference for fascist radical ideas. Choosing him would definitely mean an ideological alignment towards Germany, which might bring us some extra benefits and sooth the agitated hearts of our right-wing supporters."

The latter would allow for a closer relationship with Germany and [GER.GetLeader], who has already made vague promises about granting us our lost territories. On the other hand, if we wanted to get closer to the Allies, we would have to undergo an extensive 'cleansing' of the cabinet and remove all who think siding with Germany is best for our nation.

The weight of power in europe has shifted dramatically, and war is on the horizon, which all of our advisors agree on. [ROOT.GetLeader] needs to decide what the future fate of our nation should be. By restoring Austria-Hungary to its former glory, we could stabilize our position and be assertive of our own fate. \nHowever, many agree that the reason why the original Austria-Hungary didn't survive was not just the loss of the World War, but the fact that it was a multiethnic state, where all the ethnicities and cultures apart from hungarian and austrian felt severely supressed. \n\nThis is why [ROOT.GetLeader] has voiced his idea of creating a trialist Empire, consisting of the major three cultures; Austrian, Hungarian and Croatian. This could be a vital step in securing the persistence of our nation without the risk of collapse. Of course, there are other cultures within the Empire, such as Czech, Slovak and Ukrainean, which would still feel left out, but since the numbers indicate these being rather a 'minority', the long term effects would be less severe. \n[ROOT.GetLeader] needs to choose wisely, as once the decision has been made, there will be no way back..."

 LH.279.d:0 "With [ROOT.GetLeader] finally firmly sitting on the throne of his birthright, wearing the holy crown, he has called a meeting to discuss the future of our country. Many are aware that Otto will want to restore the Empire of his father Karl, but the question has arisen what kind of empire it should be. As the Danubian Confederation is not an idea that is being revived, it is up to us to shape and form the empire to make it exactly how we want it to be. \n\nIn Karl's mind, the Confederation would be a union of kingdoms with equal rights, unlike the Austro-Hungarian concept, which left the other kingdoms without any power. The powers of this Confederation would be equally divided among the kingdoms, and an Imperial Diet would make sure all kingdoms have their say in both internal as well as external affairs. The seperate kingdoms would be able to send their prime ministers and diplomats to the Diet, where the current matters would be discussed and - depending on the constitution - be decided with democratic votes, or by the emperor himself. The currency of the kingdoms would be individual, just as the official language, though German would be the general diplomatic language of the empire. \nThis very modern view on an empire could be compared to the United States of America, as it would in a way be the 'United States of the Danube'. Bearing all of this in mind, Otto is facing a very important decision; The constitution of the federation. Otto's liberal views are very well known to his advisors and family, which begs the question if the empire should be liberal or conservative. A liberal empire would mean the highest decentralisation possible, with full sovereign control by the seperate kingdoms, but with one common emperor, who would serve a rather ceremonial role. A conservative and monarchic federation would work more like an empire of the past, with the emperor having significant amount of power. The Imperial Diet would still exist, though the emperor himself would have much more control over the decisions and would always have the final word on new laws and generally all decisions made. \n\nHaving a more liberal stance would bring the benefit of ideologically moving towards the west and granting freedoms to the kingdoms would assure that the empire could never again suffer a breakup like the one after the World War. However, this would severely limit our decision making capabilities, while a centralised rule would bring more stability and power, as well as flexibility, since the decisions don't need a vote. \n\nIt is up to our king to decide what he prefers."

Then, our alliance called the Little Entente was still stable and well alive, which gave the possibility of diplomatic pressure towards Hungary, who then drafted the law. \nNow, they have officially made steps to renounce the law, which means that a Habsburg is probably about to take the throne, and with him all of his claims to our lands! If we are to stop them from getting claims on our lands and with them the possibility of loosing our sovereignty, we must rekindle the idea of the Little Entente - maybe te others are willing to reform the alliance to contain the new threat. \n\nHow will we respond to these news?"

Therefore, after Karl IV.'s final try to take the Hungarian throne, we were issued an ultimatum to instate the dethronement law, to ensure Hungary would never be able to return to its old borders. But the alliance was not just targeted against us; it was also a defensive pact to stop both Italian and Bulgarian expansion. \nThe dethronement law itself has'nt really had an impact on our history ever since, but the Little Entente - realising that there are more important threats than us, and due to internal ideological issues - has gotten weaker ever since its formation in 1920. \n\nHowever, with the threat of a possible Habsbrug restoration, they are now willing to revive the Entente to a fully fledged alliance, should it come to war. \n\nShould we choose to carry out our ambitions to renounce the law, and the threat of war was'nt just a bluff move, we could easily convince Bulgaria and Italy to help us, as we would have a mutual goal in defeating the Little Entente. \nWe should decide quickly, as the paperwork for the renouncement has already commenced and war will be declared as soon as the deed is officially completed. If we choose to halt the process, we are still very much able to elect a Hungarian king, which would be no problem for our neighbours. After all, Romania and Yugoslavia are kingdoms too, as are we.

Luckily, the party itself does'nt have too many followers, and after their recent coup attempt most of them were exiled to Germany to escape a conviction here in Hungary. \n\nFerenc Szálasi has reached a dead end in his attempt to fuse all the fascist parties, as the Scythe Cross has distanced themselves multiple times from his party, claiming it to be far to soft to achieve anything. \n\nOne last ditch effort can be made, however, as the leader of the scythe cross - Zoltán Böszörmény - is in Germany and has lost a lot of his power and followers. He is not in a position to decline our offer to join the party, and pardon him, which would allow him to finally return to his beloved homeland. \nThe problem is, that Böszörmény is as powerhungry as it gets, and it is unlikely he would willingly subordinate himself under Szálasi.. \nIf we wish, we could use this meeting as a ruse and contact the German authorities for permission to abduct Böszörmény during the meeting and lock him up for good in the dungeons of the Budapest castle."

Of course, [ROOT.GetLeader] would still stay absolute ruler of this empire. \n\nThis highly progressive theory is very uncommon amongst the fascists, and since it has never been tried before, we Hungarians could be the one's forming the path of other nations, as they might follow us in our endevours. Furthermore, Romania and Bulgaria shall be established as puppet states of Hungária, so that we can help them in developing into a modern, hungarist society. But first, we need to secure the territories that will be a part of Hungária.

 LH.306.d:0 "Today, amidst a huge mass of supporters, [HUN_prime_minister_name] announced the formation of his newly founded Movement of life (Magyar Élet Mozgalom) in the Budapest Vigadó. \n\n"We want to live a new Hungarian life on ancient Hungarian soil. I am not standing here now, as the head of the government, to give a government program, but to seek and present the great ideological goals that unite in the spirit of a radical right-wing reform policy, thus helping to find this new Hungarian life. Just as the legendary deer led us to our new homeland, we shall start with the enlightening idea, which means today's new Hungarian life. Hungarian brothers, understand and hear what we want: a new Hungary, a nationalist society, a military spirit, racial self-awareness, racial protection, spiritual reform, i.e Christian morality, sacrifice. Social reform, i.e the building of social justice, the usefulness of the service done to the nation, economic reform, Hungarian land for the Hungarians, the fight against poverty, and the respect for work, public purity, Hungarian life!" \n\nThese were the words of [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s opening speech, wich left the audience baffled and led to them cheering for [HUN_prime_minister_short], as they stood up clapping. Visibly happy, [HUN_prime_minister_short] has hereby achieved a great step towards total control and while [ROOT.GetLeader] was not able to stop him, he is keeping a watchful eye on [HUN_prime_minister_short]. How much the movement will grow in the following months and years is questionable, but what is sure is, that he has gotten considerable amount of support. Reports have reached us, saying that the Hungarists are not happy with this new movement and are preparing for ideological war against the new threat..."

 LH.307.d:0 "With the Hungarian Life movement being well received amongst the population, Ferenc Szálasi has made a public statement today. Fearing the loss of his own power, he called for the denouncement of the newly established Hungarian Life movement, proclaiming ideological war against [HUN_prime_minister_name] and his party! Just as the news of this statement reached [HUN_prime_minister_short] in his office, another report was made: A factory in the capital was sabotaged and is now incapable of producing army equipment. Hungarist symbols such as the arrow cross were sprayed on the walls, calling for the people of the lower classes to rise up and join them in their quest of dominance over the nation and the acceptance of Szálasi as its solemn leader. In addition to that, it seems Szálasi has managed to come to an agreement with Zoltán Böszörmény, leader of the Scythe Cross group, and they have as such joined arms in the fight against us... \n\nThis could potentially be a great threat for the Hungarian Life movement, and a clear declaration of war by the Hungarists. As it is impossible to cooperate with them, we have no other choice than answering their violent actions with violence, until there is one clear winner in this fight. \n\n[HUN_prime_minister_short] will hold a press conference calling out to the nation not to believe the Hungarists and give promises of retaliating for what they did to the factory, which cost many workers their jobs until repairs have been made."

 LH.308.d:0 "With the current war against the Russians waging, our troops have reached the river Don in the east. The river, that connects the black sea with the Don lake, makes a turn just before Stalingrad and ends in the region of Tula. \nOur troops have suffered tremendous losses at the said riverbend near Stalingrad, and as a result, many officers and wounded soldiers were retired and returned to Hungary. Knowing how the face of war, and the soviet soldiers, these men are a most valuable ressource in guaranteeing our nation's borders. [ROOT.GetLeader] has therefore initiated a new project called Keleti Arcvonal Bajtársi Szövetség, or short KABSz, to organize a paramilitary group consisting of these very men that fought near Stalingrad. \n\nThe first recruitment campaign has already been started, with a presentational opening speech by [HUN_prime_minister_short] himself. \nThe logo of the KABSz is a Skull with two crossed blades behind it, with the writing "Victory" on it. The movement's official motto is "Rather a hero for a moment, than a slave for a lifetime!"

However, they propose that their current leader, [FROM.GetLeader] stays their leader, together with the demand for additional freedom in terms of self-government and economy. They will of course allow us to access their ressources for a much lower price and it would come with complete cooperation with any decisions made by [ROOT.GetLeader]. \n\nWhat should we answer?"

The only thing missing to get the ball rolling is our decision in how to handle things. \nOn the on hand, we could simply deport them. Our army will help in gathering the affected people and load them on trains to take them as far away from our borders as possible. Jewish people will be sent to Israel, and gypsies to northern India. This would cost us manpower and equipment, but we could permanently solve the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, we have the option to enslave them and make them work for us. By putting them into forced labor, we might not rid ourselves of them, but at least they will have a concrete use for the government. They will be producing equipment for the army, and helping in the construction of new factories and other buildings. However, they will need to be fed and appropriate barracks and allocated manpower will be needed."

 LH.313.d:0 "We have recently occupied the territory of Zaolzie. As it was never part of the historical borders of Hungary, the question has arisen as to what should happen with it. The population is mainly Czech, but a considerable amount is also Polish. We could use the opportunity to hand it over to the Poles, and use it as a token of friendship between our nations. Or we could simply keep it - after all, we are forming a new Hungarian nation, and Zaolzie could be a part of it if we wanted it to."

Luckily, we were prepared for this outcome, as it was clear that [FROM.GetLeader] would want something in return for their help and a vague promise of an alliance would be too little. As we have nothing else to offer, we could send them an offer to formally become a subject nation of theirs, thereby establishing a foothold in the balkans for them.

In return for our help in the upcoming civil war, they are willing to give up their sovereignty and become our puppet after the conclusion of their war. This could offer us a strong foothold in the balkans, which could make our territorial ambitions easier to fulfil in Yugoslavia. What should we answer?"

 LH.318.t:0 "The disaster in Rome"
 LH.318.d:0 "Having sent our delegation to Rome for the second time, [FROM.GetLeader] got the whole thing the wrong way and sent them home immediatly. Our envoys report of [FROM.GetLeader]'s harsh temper and questioned our honour as to why we were so cowardly to offer our own independance in return for guns.

 LH.320.d:0 "As agreed, the Italians have sent weapons and even men to fight for us and help us win the war. The war is now won, and we have established full control over the nation.

Béla Imrédy was the lead developer of the project, having used his contacts as the head of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank. The project is not only supposed to help our army to be equipped, but also to help overcome the last hurdles of the economic crisis. Luckily, the national debts have been decreasing over the past years, which made the whole project possible. \n\nOf the one billion Pengős provided, 600 million are planned to be used on military spending, starting with a first 3-year plan consisting of the "Huba I" program, and 400 million for the improvement the internal stability of the nation. The announcement of this sum has lead to many investors to believe that Hungary will be the next location for an economic boom. This has lead to a rapid increase of stocks and shares, as well as the people's willingness to accept the fact that a seperate one-time tax was levied, which was not welcomed at the time... \n\nNevertheless, experts are sure that this program will greatly benefit the country's capability of Hungary's market competitiveness, as well as significantly srengthen the army."

There, he offered Hubay a pact similar to the Bethlen-Peyer pact, which would allow for the fascists to be in parliament with limited power, but promising to abide the constitution in return.

However, a recent street fight with various members of the party has resulted in the interior ministry to issue yet another note of banishment. \n\nThe current interior minister has officially signed the documents necessary and has stated that the party was too much like the NAP as the reason for its dissolution.

[ROOT.GetLeader] has issued a general amnesty, following our country regaining parts of Transylvania. His followers received him with great enthusiasm, and swiftly officially handed the role as party leader over to him. Luckily, this development has not stopped the decline of his party.

The Treaty of Trianon had been signed by the previous government, which angered the people and caused for Kun's popularity to skyrocket as a result. Kun fulfilled his promises by attacking the Czechoslovakian nation in June to recover the Slovakian parts of Hungary, also known as "Upper Hungary". The initial results were surprisingly positive, and General Aurél Stromfelds troops had made big gains in the north. Unfortunately, the government announced the Slovak Soviet Republic in Presov on June 16, which caused the Hungarian nationalists and patriots to realise that Kun had no intention of returning to the old borders of Hungary, but rather spread the communist ideology throughout europe. The tensions that arose from this caused the army to slowly but surely disintegrate, as many leading officers - including Stromfeld - resigned out of protest. \n\nThe Hungarian government found itself in a dire situation; the military victories in the north were'nt enough to win the war, since Hungary was simultaneously at war with Romania and Yugoslavia. In the response to this, the french government offered the withdrawal of Romanian troops from Hungary, if the Soviet Republic would withdraw the remaining loyal troops from Slovakia. Kun agreed. However, the Romanians did not withdraw, and Kun sent the demoralised troops to fight the Romanians. Unable to hold the ground, the communist forces lost to the Romanians, who ultimately occupied Budapest and sacked the communist government, leading to Kun fleeing to Vienna. \n\nKun has since learned his lesson and is now trying a new approach. This time, we will openly declare that it is our intention to spread communism to our neighbouring countries. No deceits, no false promises. The people will know what awaits them. However, the question remains if it is prudent to outright attack our northern neighbours, or if in these modern times it is better to stur a communist uprising, which could come to win a civil war with our help..."

After the Romanian forces crossed the Tisza river, the French Foreign Minister demanded the Romanians to fall behind the agreed demarcation line of the previously signed Paris Peace Conference. However, the Romanian troops crossed the river and advanced further through Hungary, which greatly displeased the Allies. \n\nAfter the political disaster of declaring the Slovak Soviet Republic, the Hungarian army was severely weakend and the generals were replaced by the political comissars, who at often times had little to no military experience. Despite this, a major offensive was launched over the river. While initially succesfull, the Romanian army was better equiped and had a strong morale. A counterattack was the result, which lead to the destruction of the already weakend hungarian army. The Romanians marched right into Budapest and occupied the city, and shortly after the entire country with the exception of a small area around the lake Balaton, where the soon-to-be leader of Hungary Miklós Horthy formed a militia and planned to march to Budapest once the occupation had ended. \n\nWith all of this in mind, do we really have the strength to fight the Romanians again?

After Kun had refused to sign the peace treaty with the Romanians and French, who demanded the complete demobilisation of the army, after they had already not kept a previously agreed upon promise, the French launched an invasion of southern Hungary through Yugoslavia. Of course, Yugoslav divisions were also involved in this short invasion - short, because there was hardly any resistance to them, since the Hungarian army was focusing on repelling the Romanians from the Tisza river. \n\nEver since then, the Yugoslavs have tried to undermine Hungary as much as possible, but also showed some friendly faces, unlike Hungary's other neighbours.

Though not a prominent member of the party, the minister was still a member of the [HUN.GetCommunistParty]. \n\nOn his way home after a long day of hard and honest work, he was ambushed in a side street and shot in the head. The savages did'nt even have the decency or respect to honour the dead by burying him or getting rid of the body in a humane way. \nInstead, the phrase "Death to Communism" was carved into the poor mans chest and he was hung on a street lamp, just to be found by a woman the next morning while on her way to the grocery store. This act of terrorism cannot be tolerated and it is high time we actively do something against it!"

It was only after half an hour that a police officer realised that it was an unannounced gathering by the M.O.V.E, trying to get people in on their side. Great banners were hung up with anti-communist slogans and even some with pictures of [ROOT.GetLeader] being decapitated or hung. The gathering became quite big quite quickly and it the police force mustered all its available men to stop the rally. Many arrests were made and the police even faced violent resistance. Luckily, the gathering was ultimately dissolved and the day could carry on as normal, but it is still worrying to see how many people are actually sympathetic to the cause propagated by the M.O.V.E. \n\nUnfortunately, amidst the chaos all the attending members of the M.O.V.E could escape. It seems they had someone watching over them from a higher building and warned them that the police force was on its way. Next time we will get them!"

 LH.396.t:0 "The Generals Trial"
 LH.396.d:0 "Many of those generals that joined us in the civil war are now under suspicion of joining the anti-communist movement called M.O.V.E. [ROOT.GetLeader]'s suspicions have grown ever stronger and he has decided to purge the officer corps, so that it can be reborn in a pure red colour. \n\nA secondary aim is to get rid of those who received a military education in the times of the old government, specifically from the Ludovica Academy. The vacant positions will be filled with young generals, loyal to the communist ideology. After an extensive research period, it has become clear that 85% of the military staff used to be horthyist, and it was László Sólyom who allowed these anti-communist officers to stay or even be reinstated. Not only that, Sólyom and his colleagues are suspected to be Yugoslav and French spies!  Through the last few months, many officers of lower and higher ranks were detained and kept in the ÁVH headquarters, and it is now finally time to start the trials. \n\nThe trials were carried out on a nice and sunny day, and as there were many trials to be held, the sentences were decided all the faster. Most trials didn't last longer than 5 minutes, because it was clear to everyone that the punishment would either be the death sentence, or forced labor for life. In the end, 12 officers including Sólyom were sentenced to execution and the other 6 main accused officers to labor for life. The rest of the lower ranking officers were sentenced to life in prison."

 LH.397.t:0 "The László Rájk Trial"
 LH.397.d:0 "To the great surpise of all, of all people it is Lázsló Rajk to be the next to be accused. While seeming to be a rolemodel stalinist communist, Rajk has recently become quite popular amongst the social democrats due to his recent speeches, in which he advocated for a less strict way of communism. \n\nNot only that, but as [ROOT.GetLeader] spoke to Lavrenty Beriya last time he visited Moscow, Beriya gave him the order to uncover a supposed Trotskyist conspiracy within the hungarian communist leadership. Eager to get justice for the accused, [ROOT.GetLeader] spent an entire week with Beriya discussing the possible suspects for the conspiracy. After lengthy discussions, they both came to the conclusion, that it can only be Lázsló Rajk to be the conspirator. The two made a list of Rájks closest friends and possible accomplices, who are now on the trial with him and are a sum total of 8 people. \n\nOf course, Rájk always denied the accusations and even after a lengthy torture session was not ready to confess. It was János Kádár and Mihály Farkas who finally managed to convince him to accept the accusations, promising him that he would not be sentenced to death. This, of course was a lie. Nevertheless, Rajk said the confession out loud, which he had learnt by heart the day before. THis was enough to charge him with all the accusations and he and the other 7 accused were subsequently sentenced with the death sentence, which will be carried out tomorrow."
 LH.397.a:0 "Good riddance!"
 LH.398.t:0 "The Party Conspiracy"
 LH.398.d:0 "After the Rajk trial the Trotskyist conspiracy seemed to have been settled. However, [ROOT.GetLeader] had the epiphany that there was one other person, who could have behind the Trotskyist plot: János Kádár. Could it be, that Kádár framed Rajk with the trotskyist activities, knowing that Rajk would be sentenced and therefore could carry on with his plot? It would seem far to perfect for Kádár! \n\nEven so, even if Kádár wasn't behind it, many say that he has not been doing a good job of removing the anti-socialist movement in Hungary. Sensing the upcoming purge, Kádár resigned most of his positions and moved down the political ladder, hoping that he could avoid being purged. But we see through this petty trickery. His fear of getting killed went so far that he wrote [ROOT.GetLeader] a letter stating that he still is "politically backward" and "ideologically untrained". Though offering his resignation, [ROOT.GetLeader] ordered his membership to be renewed and Kádár seemed to have thought to have gotten back into [ROOT.GetLeader]'s good books. \nOne day, Kádár was called into the Communist Headquarters in Budapest, and as he left his house our ÁVH officers were already waiting for him to arrest him. Today, Kádár stands trial, accused of being a co-conspirator of the Trotskyist plot, an apparent communist (as he did not stop the anti-socialist movement, it is not clear that he is a communist at all!) and for being a spy of Horthy's police. Not long ago Kádár was the one giving the beatings in the interrogation room, and now it was him being beaten into confessing - which he did. [ROOT.GetLeader] was in the interrogation room visibly enjoying the beatings, the mercury being poored over Kádárs face and the ÁVH interrogators urinating into his pried-open mouth. \n\nThe trial itself was short, and Kádár was sentenced to life in prison."

 LH.399.d:0 "Cardinal Mindszenty and his companions are a very dangerous bunch of people. Not only are they all devout preachers of monarchism, but he has quite a high rank in the roman catholic church, always keeping in contact with the current pope. This is utterly unacceptable and we communists are absolutely against the church, and especially against the monarchists! \n\nOur police took him to the ÁVH headquarters to interrogate him, as we had suspicions of espionage and conspiring against the government. Today, he has been taken to court to be sentenced by a people's tribunal, with [ROOT.GetLeader] as its head judge. The ÁVH has managed to get a written statement from him confessing to all those crimes we had suspected him of doing, and it is his signature and the bottom of the paper confirming them; József Mindszenty c.f. \n\nThe Tribunal has decided to sentence him to a life time in prison, together with six of his accomplices, one of which being Pál Esterházy, one of the last leading members of the monarchist movement."

 LH.400.d:0 "While the victory of the civil war is still being celebrated, the right opposition utterly crushed and our new leader [ROOT.GetLeader] being praised by all sides, a new enemy has presented itself to us. As if all the hardship wasn't enough, there still are some that oppose [ROOT.GetLeader]'s rise to power. \n\nThis time, it is the social democrats, who have been our allies up to know, who think that the newly established political order is far too authoritarian. [ROOT.GetDemocraticLeader], who was at first a member of the [ROOT.GetCommunistParty] has chosen to join the [ROOT.GetDemocraticParty] and has been chosen by them to lead their movement. \n[ROOT.GetDemocraticLeader] has already publicly announced that the new government should not be led by the communists, and especially not by [ROOT.GetLeader]! This new nusiance needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible in order to secure the stability in our country. \n\nIf anything, history has taught us that a civil war usually shakes up a nation in a way that can be very dangerous for the new ruling party, as the power balance can quickly shift into opposite directions. In order to stop yet another civil war, we need to be careful about how to deal with [ROOT.GetDemocraticLeader], and it won't be enough to outright arrest him."

Many received a pardon in the exchange for joining the national army as regular soldiers, after completing a training program. This seems to be very effective, as up to 80% of the prisoners accepted the deal. \n[HUN_rongyos_garda_leader_name] was also caught and brought to a public trial, which swiftly sentenced him and other higher ranking members of the Gárda to death. [HUN_rongyos_garda_leader_name] was executed by a shooting squad this morning in a public space, open to anyone wanting to see the execution.

As they make out the majority of the population, it should be no problem to use the overwhelmingly large numbers to take control. But there is one problem. Of all the other fascist groups, there is one in particular that is hindering us from doing this; the "Kaszaskeresztes Párt", or in other words the "Scythe Cross Part" led by Zoltán Böszörmény. Böszörmény is also a strong believer of the fact that the countries most valuable members are the one's at the bottom, who through their hard work can support all the others, and without whom the country couldn't exist. \nHaving already tried a coup on May 1st 1936, his followership has decreased due to his failed attempt, but with him pardoned, he has once again resurfaced and started to rally his people to gain more and more followers. In a twisted turn of events this has led to the ultimate situation, where we find ourselves in a race to gain the control and support of the people. [HUN_prime_minister_name] has already announced that he will be touring the country to personally oversee the gathering of supporters, and sources say that Böszörmény has made his own plans..."

 LHelections.1.t:0 "The Fall of [HUN_prime_minister_short]"
 LHelections.1.d:0 "Unfortunately, [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s previous agreement with Kálmán Hubay has turned out to be less than beneficial. Allowing National Socialists into parliament has lead to the western powers disliking us even more, and István Bethlen, who still has a considerable amount of informal influence in politics has not responded favourably to it. In addition, [ROOT.GetLeader] has lost all his trust in [HUN_prime_minister_short], who has today officially handed in his resignation, which was accepted immediatly.\n\nThe president of parliament and a small group of ministers have already elected the next prime minister; and it will be his first task is to organize the 34th Eucharistic Congress. However, as [ROOT.GetLeader] still nominally holds the power to select the prime minister, he will have the choice between the two favoured candidates; Béla Imrédy, who is the director of the state bank, or László Bárdossy, who is considered a very bright-minded and skilled diplomat."

It is imperative that he weakens the Hungarists, since their popularity has only been lifted even more since he was imprisoned and Darányi made a deal with Kálmán Hubay. In order to achieve this, [HUN_prime_minister_short] has suggested various changes be made in the country. A new law has been drafted that allows social workers to be payed higher wages, as well as many of the lower class professions. Additionally, pensions will be raisedd and public services will be expanded upon. With this, parliament hopes to decrease the influence of the arrow cross movement. \n\nHowever, [HUN_prime_minister_short] has proposed further changes that are a little bit more concerning to [ROOT.GetLeader]. Parliament has voted for changing the voting law in favour of the higher and middle classes, to secure the ruling party's popularity to stay high and take the right of voting away from those, who would support the arrow cross. While this may most likely help the arrow cross situation, it also means that [HUN_prime_minister_short] has gained more power..."

 LHelections.3.d:0 "Prime Minister [HUN_prime_minister_short] has presented an industrialisation project to parliament today. Together with some other ministers, he pans on making the newly acquired Northern Transylvania a more urbanized area, as the Romanians have neglected the area for quite some time now. Therefore, the first step in making the area more susceptile to factories and companies, it needs to be connected via rail. \n\nSince it used to be Romanian, the change of borders has caused the railway network to be fragmented, which only slows down our production capability. As of tomorrow, a new railway network will be built, spanning from Szatmárnémeti all the way to Székelyudvarhely. \nThe plan has met with a lot of applause and [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s popularity has only risen more."

The prime minister, being a family man, would like to create a new organisation, called "Országos Nép- és Családvédelmi Alap" (ONCSA), or "National People and Family Protection Fund". This Protection Fund will help Hungarian families in need and provide shelter to those that cannot afford it. Additionally, it will support bigger families and encourage births, to help repopulate the territories we gained with ethnic Hungarians. \n\nThe new article of law that makes this new organisation a state controlled one has already been drafted and waits for [ROOT.GetLeader]'s approval. The first steps of the organisation is to build approximately 12,000 standard homes and around the same amount of people will receive land and livestock. Social Inspectors will be available to all those who need help. Surely, this organisation will bring the party a lot of popularity."

 LHelections.5.d:0 "Yugoslavia is the only power in our vicinity that is not yet affected by the Germans and have therefore still kept their neutrality. The idea of a Yugoslavian-Hungarian friendship has been in the air since 1939, and we think that it is in the best interest of both parties if a treaty as such would be signed. As a matter of fact, the Yugoslavian government has responded very kindly to the idea. They fear too much German influence in the Balkans and would gladly sign a friendship treaty if that would keep the German influence down. \n\n[HUN_prime_minister_short] has sent Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky to Belgrade to discuss the terms of this agreement. The current Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, however, seems to be a friend of the Germans, which is why interestingly enough [GER.GetLeader] is fully supporting our treaty. \n\nThe treaty, that was now signed consists of 2 points: \n1. There will be lasting peace and eternal friendship between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.\n2. The High Contracting Parties agree to consult on any matter which they consider may affect their mutual relations.\n\nLet us hope this treaty will guarantee our friendship!"
 LHelections.5.a:0 "We still want their territory though..."
 LHelections.6.t:0 "The Fate of Yugoslavia"
 LHelections.6.d:0 "The recent coup in Yugoslavia has changed the situation quite considerably. Just one day after the coup, the Germans asked us for permission to station troops on our southern border. Refering to our nation's wishes to return to old Pre-Trianon borders, we were strongly "advised" by the Germans to enter the war with them. In light of the situation, [HUN_prime_minister_short] has handed in his resignation, but recalled it a few hours later in the hopes that he could change the situation. "With the friendship pact signed, we cannot allow ourselves to betray the Yugoslavs." With this argument, the Prime Minister could persuade the high command and the crown council not to attack. However, [ROOT.GetLeader] approached him the day after with the information that this would not be the case. \n\nTo make things even worse, a telegram arrived from the [ENG.GetNameDef] warning us, that they would not tolerate a Hungarian invasion of Yugoslavia and that they guarantee Yugoslavia's borders."

His goodbye letter sharply criticises Hungarian politics and [ROOT.GetLeader], for allowing to stabbing Yugoslavia in the back and allowing the country to join the war against the UK. \n\n"We have become liars. We sided with the villains. I didn't hold you back, I'm guilty." These were [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s last words.\n\nSince the Yugoslavian government went through a coup, and there are plans to create an Independent State of Croatia, he might've been relieved that we would attack Yugoslavia, since it is not the same Yugoslavia that we signed the treaty with. May [HUN_prime_minister_name] rest in peace. \n\nWith the seat of Prime Minister empty once again, [ROOT.GetLeader] has to decided who to give the prime ministry to. In light of our close cooperation with the Germans, it is advisable to instate a German-friendly prime minister, who still has the guts to stick to the conservative side of politics and not appease the Germans ever so much. Of course, it would be best to have someone that doesn't concern himself with the question of Hungarian national ideology, like some of his predecessors did, and we know how that turned out..."

 LHelections.8.d:0 "Our Regent [ROOT.GetLeader] is unfortunately getting old. Health problems plague him through the days, which clearly affect his decision-making capabilities. The last crown council meeting has brought forth a question: What will happen to the country after our beloved regent dies? As we all know, having a regent only brought stability and prosperity to the country, and as such, [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided to keep the regency going after his death. \n\nAfter a small speech, the politicians present decided it would be best to hold a voting as to who should be [ROOT.GetLeader]'s heir. \nAfter an improvised anonymus voting, the outcome is less than surprising; The politicians of the crown council have voted for Horthy's son [HUN_horthy_eldest_son] to be [ROOT.GetLeader]'s heir, with an impressive two third majority. \n\nAs expected, the members of the council have chosen a member of Horthy's family to be the successor, though not all seem to be happy with the outcome. Prime minister [HUN_prime_minister_name] has voiced his personal opinions just before the voting started, in hopes of persuading some of the votees to choose his preferred candidate, namely Albrecht Franz von Habsburg-Teschen, who in the early 1930s claimed the Hungarian throne, but backed down in favor of Otto Habsburg. \nShocked by [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s suggestion, [ROOT.GetLeader] swiftly demanded the voting take place at the moment and dismissed the council as soon as the final result was declared..."

Visibly disgruntled, he informed [HUN_prime_minister_short] that his suggestion of making a Habsburg - a deeply national socialist one - Regent of Hungary has caused him to rethink the position of prime minister. According to him, [HUN_prime_minister_short] could no longer be a trusted with the most important task of being the prime minister, especially in times like these, when the Germans are right on our borders and surrounding us. \n\nIn addition, [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s actions have clearly stated the obvious, namely that his views have grown much closer to those of [GER.GetLeader], which is simply unacceptable. Therefore, [HUN_prime_minister_short] will be expected to hand in his resignation at once, and the regent will install a new prime minister, who can hopefully steer the nation in the right direction."

The western powers have landed on european shores and it is just a matter of time until we will capitulate, just as the Italians before us. \n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] has issued orders to immediatly set get the peace bureau running and contact the Allies to make a deal to swith sides. If we are lucky, they will allow us to keep our territories and aligning ourselves with them would also stop the Soviets from occupying us. However, dealing with the enemy during Germany's watchful eye is a risky undertaking, and the war might still turn into our favour... Should we contact the Allies?"

 LHelections.11.t:0 "[HUN_prime_minister_name]'s Political Reforms"
 LHelections.11.d:0 "The shift from a conservative prime minister to German occupation can really be felt by the current prime ministers ideas and reforms. [HUN_prime_minister_short] has presented his stance on how to handle the politics within our nation. Yesterday he has delivered an extensive plan on solidifying his control over the nation and its politics. \n\nFor one, all leftist parties are banned and not allowed to operate anywhere in the country. Press and media will be censored, as to not give the population false hopes of an allied victory. Furthermore, conscription will drastically be raised, labor unions will be disbanded. In addition, the oilfields in the Hungarian plains will be handed over to the Germans to assist the war effort. \n[HUN_prime_minister_short] has also issued the ban of the Arrow Cross Movement under Szálasi, as his form of fascism is considered to be harmful to the stability of the country.\n\nThough [ROOT.GetLeader] is strongly against these reforms, he is still hoping that he can make a difference by keeping his position. If he were to resign, the risk of someone like [HUN_prime_minister_name] becoming Regent is far too high. It is a risk he doesn't want to take. For the time being, we will simply have to accept the situation the way it is and hope that [ROOT.GetLeader] will have more freedom to operate in the future..."

His recent speech in parliament, when he urged for the creation of a new political position of the "Leader of the Nation" was the last straw. [HUN_prime_minister_short] has clearly set his views to become dictator of Hungary, which is of course unacceptable. \n\nWith his dismissal the nation needs a new prime minister, and [ROOT.GetLeader] has a few very talented and conservative candidates available. Each one has their own strengths and weeknesses, but [ROOT.GetLeader] has voiced his preference of Pál Teleki taking over.

According to him, the mental stress that the task of prime minister is giving him is something he just cannot stand any longer, as well as just idly standing by while his country is steering towards ruin. In his resignation he sharply criticises Hungarian politics and [ROOT.GetLeader], for allowing to stabbing Yugoslavia in the back and allowing the country to join the war against the UK. \n\nSince the Yugoslavian government went through a coup, and there are plans to create an Independent State of Croatia, there is no indication that the friendship treaty with Yugoslavia is being broken through a declaration of war, since it is not the same Yugoslavia that we signed the treaty with.

A general feeling of relief can be observed within internal politics, and many hope that this action has caused a chain reaction to move the situation to the better. \n\n[ROOT.GetLeader]'s trust in the politicians has vanished, which is why he has decided to give Géza Lakatos, member of the high command, the task of creating a military government, and with it the prime ministry.

Once again, he was proven that he misjudged the person he chose to become prime minister. \n\nOne of the things that [HUN_prime_minister_name] has strongly encouraged (and which was backed by Germany and Veesenmayer) was the deportation of the jewish population of our country. They were violently killed, put in ghettos and deported to Germany to serve as "borrowed Jews" and support the war effort through forced labour. As the situation is sprialing completely out of control, [ROOT.GetLeader] has decided to step in and defy German pressure.

In exchange, [SOV.GetLeader] asks us to join their side of the war against Germany. By accepting, we would effectively stab the Germans in the back and would risk occupation by them, but it might be a prudent decision to join the Russians instead of the Germans. However, [ROOT.GetLeader] has stated his strong disdain against the Soviet Union and has urged not to accept the offer.

Not to mention his heroic contribution in the revolution we just carried out. Allowing him to form the "Magyar Dolgozók Pártja", or the "Hungarian Woker's Party" will surely help us further in our cause.\n\nThe other option would be to put János Kádár in power.

We have approximately one month to prepare. \n\nThat does'nt mean though, that we cannot participate in influencing the people who are voting. We should begin extensive propaganda campaigns to ensure our success at the elections. We have'nt come this far only to be beaten by the smallholders party or even Horthy's "Nemzeti Egységes Párt"! \n\nIn order for this to succeed, we need a strong and capable man on the lead. After granting amnesty to all communist politicians we have chosen two possible suitors for the position. The first one, János Kádár, who displayed true valour and bravery in the past years, by participating in the massive workers strike of 1930, resulting in his incarceration. There, he organised a successful hunger strike and was subsequently released in 1935. After that, he joined the socialist party, but never really felt at home there. By allowing him to form a party and leading it we will surely be able to overcome all future obstacles. \nOn the other hand we can choose Imre Nagy. Being a hero of the Great War (italian front, later eastern front), he is very well trained in military and tactical affairs. Though not present in Hungary during the first Soviet Republic in 1919 (he was in Russia that time), he could learn valuable lessons of communism in Siberia. As a political spy, he returned to Hungary in 1921 and joined the social democratic party, growing quite fond of the ideology as a milder form of communism.

 LHelections.24.a:0 "Fantastic!"
 
 LHelections.25.t:0 "Election Day!"
 LHelections.25.d:0 "Finally, the day has come. The election day has ended, all the polls have been closed and the votes have been counted. [HUN.GetCommunistLeader] and his associates are eagerly awaiting the results, in hopes of a victory. \n\nAt around 17:30 the memo has finally reached the communist party's headquarters; the communist party did not win the majority! With this being a great failure for all the party members, the message of this defeat sturred unrest among the members of the party. Wild accusations of bribery, corruption and incompetence were made and the meeting was close to a big fight. \n\nWhile the party will now be allowed to be in the opposition, it is not what most had hoped for..."
 LHelections.25.a:0 "Oh no!"
 
 LHelections.26.t:0 "Rákosi's Takeover"
 LHelections.26.election.d:0 "The recent defeat of the communist party in the elections resulted in mass desertions. Many left the party, calling it incapable of existing. The communists, who were already difficult to keep at bay and were difficult to persuade to join a peaceful takeover are extremely disappointed, many believing it to have been the wrong choice. One of the most prominent members of the communists - Mátyás Rákosi - has used this opportunity to gather the party dissidants and merged them into his own communist party, which is now preparing for a violent revolution, just as most communists opted for in the first case. They have taken arms in the rural regions of Hungary, and currently marching to the capital!"
 LHelections.26.bop.d:0 "Today is a very sad day. [ROOT.GetLeader] was sitting in his office as the news reached him: It seems [ROOT.GetNeutralLeader] has gathered enough influence, followers and generally spoken power, that he is now attempting to take over the government. \nHis followers have met on the outskirts of Budapest and are marching to the capital to take over violently. And the worst part is, that the armed forces have mostly taken his side. [ROOT.GetLeader] is now alone, with a fraction of the manpower he used to have and will now have to fight to the death, since mercy won't be expected from [ROOT.GetNeutralLeader]."
 LHelections.26.a:0 "WHAT is happening?"
 
 LHelections.27.t:0 "The Rákosi Incident"
 LHelections.27.d:0 "During the recent revolution, comrade Mátyás Rákosi was locked up in prison due to being a political enemy of the previous government. [ROOT.GetLeader] has always deemed Rákosi a dangerous character in the communist world, and has therefore not attempted to rescue him during the revolution, even though the chaos would have made for the perfect pretense to stage a prison brake. \n\nIn an ironic twist of events, Rákosi was somehow still able to escape prison! After the fighting was over, the new government needed to make changes in staff, which was used by Rákosi to his advantage. In a sly trickery, he managed to escape prison and fled to the countryside, where he apparently was kept safe by a farmer family. \n\nNow, Rákosi has returned to Budapest and has covertly started a new political party, the "Magyar Dolgozók Pártja". Unlike before, Rákosi has found a loophole in the ideological system: He discovered anarchism to be extremely similar to communist socialism, which is why his new party embraces the ideas of anarchism and is trying to get the undecisive communists to join his party, rather than ours! Of course it is to be assumed that Rákosi will "convert" his party back to communism, should he ever rise to power, since the very idea of anarchism does not encompass a person to be a leader, which is ultimately his biggest goal. \n\nUnfortunately for us, many have already left our party to join Rákosi, as his personality and tactics of winning over followers are superb. We would love to just simply arrest him and put him back into the prison hole where he came out of, but in light of the current situation our hands are tied. The only way of getting rid of him is if we manage to get those who left us to join our party again, discredit him. Once the population turns against him, we will be able to finally get rid of him, and if the situation demands it, we will not hesitate to execute him.
 LHelections.27.a:0 "Damn this red devil!"
 
 LHelections.29.t:0 "The M.O.V.E takes over control!"
 LHelections.29.d:0 "Our efforts were futile. The M.O.V.E has finally succeeded in gathering enough support internally and externally - through bribery, blackmail and other methods - to take over control of the government. In a final ambush, during a gathering of our forces in Budapest, hundreds of M.O.V.E. supporters attacked our men, storming our headquarters, killing everyone in their way and destroying everything we have. The organisation has taken their place in the government, and have placed László Magasházy as their leader. \n\nOur gamble is lost, our cause is dissolved. We should have done better... \n\nFor now, we can only hope that the new government will follow similar policies as we would have and maybe - in the distant future - our ideas will bear more fruits."
 LHelections.29.a:0 "They have won..."
 
 LHelections.30.t:0 "The Monarchy Question"
 LHelections.30.no_boszormeny.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Great War and the exile of our king, following various government changes, the monarchy was without a king. This "kingless kingdom" has weakened our nation for long enough, and it is now up to [HUN_prime_minister_name] to solve this problem once and for all. \n\nAfter reviewing all options, he has been presented with three choices on how to go forward. \nOn the one hand, we could invite a German noble - Friedrich Franz von Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who has already made a carrier in the SS. Having him as king would considerably boost our relations with Germany. \n\nOn the other hand, we could crown our own hungarian king. Albrecht Franz von Habsburg-Teschen has already been a loyal servant to the Hungarian state, but relinquished his claim to the throne in favour of Otto von Habsburg. We do not think that this was official, which is why we could invite him. Of course, this could cause international tensions between us and our neighbours... \n\nFinally, [HUN_prime_minister_name] could simply explain the monarchy to be defined by the crown itself, not the person wearing it. Therefore, the symbol of the Holy Crown would always be protecting the Hungarian nation, no matter if there is a king or not. In this case, [HUN_prime_minister_short] will be inaugurated as the head of state, without being a monarch. The country has survived the past without a king, and will so now again."
 LHelections.30.boszormeny.d:0 "[HUN_prime_minister_name] has achieved a lot in the past years. Though having had a backlash with the failed coup attempt, in the end he actually did the unthinkable. Of course, his loyal followers explain this by stating that the Vezér got this far simply because the failure of May 1936 has only sharpened his already superior mind and through this his new plan was even more refined than the last one.\n\nHaving secured his strength, it is now time for the next step of his grande plan. In a puublic appearance in front of the Saint Mathew church in Budapest, which was also broadcasted to each and every radio station in the country, [HUN_prime_minister_short] explained to the people that the time had come to finally solve the Question of the Monarchy. Claiming that every contestant for the throne had been dismissed because of their lack of skills, [HUN_prime_minister_short] would be crowning himself king instead, and he officially proclaimed the birth of the "Magyar Nemzeti Kaszáskeresztes Királyság", or in other words the "Hungarian Scythe Cross Kingdom". \n\nAfter this, he marched into the church, guarded by his followers, to be crowned king of Hungary, which is the first time since the end of the Great War that such an event has occured."

 LHelections.31.d:0 "Having been crowned King of Hungary, [HUN_fascist_king_name] has not been idle with his position as king. During recent discussions, the ideological and philosophical differences between the two have become very clear. While [HUN_prime_minister_short] has continuously been trying to undermine the king and keep him out of the decision-making, the king has been extending his own influence, building up a strong follower base. \n\nIt seems that the directions of the head of state and the prime minister are drifting further and further apart, and if not attended to could lead to a boiling point."

 ### GENERAL EVENTS ###
 
 LHgeneralevents.1.t:0 "General [THIS.GetNameDef]'s change of allegiance"
 LHgeneralevents.1.d:0 "Through means that we are unaware of, the M.O.V.E has somehow managed to convince [THIS.GetNameDef] to back them in the current struggle for power. The current government has always treated [THIS.GetNameDef] with all the respect he deserved, and it seems this is the thank we get for letting him keep his position, even though he worked for the treacherous previous government without any problem. After we - the rightful government - took over, all generals received the offer to vow their complete loyalty to the communist cause or be relieved of their position and exiled. [THIS.GetNameDef] was one of the one's, who promised their everlasting loyalty. We now see how much this loyalty is worth... \n\nSome within the party have suggested to outright arrest [THIS.GetNameDef] for his foulness, but inlight of the high tensions, arresting him or relieving him of his duty could spark the powder keg and we really cannot afford another civil war. For now, he will be tolerated, and maybe it might even be possible to win his allegiance back, and weaken the M.O.V.E."
 LHgeneralevents.1.a:0 "Unacceptable!"
 LHgeneralevents.2.t:0 "Generals Return Home"
 LHgeneralevents.2.d:0 "With the conclusion of the spanish civil war, many volunteers have returned back home to Hungary. The valuable lessons our soldiers learnt, together with the battle experience our generals received from this conflict will surely bring us victory in any future conflicts we might have. \nAs many nations have sent their own troops to the civil war, we were also able to see how well they performed and what equipment and technology they have used. All in all, the war was a success for us in terms of gathering experience and enemy intelligence. Even our most trusted advisor, Ernő Gerő has returned to his duties."
 LHgeneralevents.2.a:0 "Welcome back!"
 LHgeneralevents.3.t:0 "General [THIS.GetNameDef] joins the Rongyos Gárda"
 LHgeneralevents.3.d:0 "Our Movement is gaining more and more momentum, as yet another prominent General has declared their support for the Rongyos Gárda, and has joined our ranks. This boost of confidence and power will only lead to snowball our power and influence and soon we will be able to take over the country."
 LHgeneralevents.3.a:0 "Welcome!" 
 LHgeneralevents.4.t:0 "General [THIS.GetNameDef] joins us as a Hungarian Expeditionary"
 LHgeneralevents.4.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has sent us aid in form of General [THIS.GetNameDef], who is an experienced fighter, having fought in the first world war, and the various smaller conflicts after it in Hungary. \n\nJust yesterday him and his very generous delivery of weapons arrived in [111.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] and [THIS.GetNameDef] is currently on his way to the front line."
 LHgeneralevents.4.a:0 "Thank you very much!"
 LHgeneralevents.5.t:0 "[THIS.GetNameDef] has returned to Hungary."
 LHgeneralevents.5.d:0 "Wether or not the outcome of the Winter War was a win or not is debateable, is it certain that our General [THIS.GetNameDef] has gained valuable experience from the fighting, which we can now use to our advantage. As one of the only Generals with actual combat experience, the value of him being loyal to us has skyrocketed. \n\nThe Rongyos Gárda is proud of him!"
 LHgeneralevents.5.a:0 "Welcome back!"
 LHgeneralevents.6.t:0 "[THIS.GetNameDef] gets inaugurated!"
 LHgeneralevents.6.d:0 "Not having fought in the civil war but returning to our service shortly after, [THIS.GetNameDef] has now earned himself the official title of Rongyos Gárda supporter, through the newly established Rongyos Gárda honorary organisation. Bearing the title of Rongyos Gárda officer is now an official reason for being socially higher ranked, and acts much like the vitézi rend during the Horthy era. In a ceremony in the Budapest basilica, [THIS.GetNameDef] received his title amidst applause and cheers."
 LHgeneralevents.6.a:0 "Welcome!"
