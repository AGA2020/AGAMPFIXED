usa.3.t:0 "Attack On Pearl Harbour"
usa.3.d:0 "An unprecedented attack on Pearl Harbor this morning at 7:48 a.m. The Japanese launched a surprise assault with over 350 aircraft. The base is in chaos—battleships have been sunk or severely damaged, including the USS Arizona and USS Oklahoma. Several other vessels and numerous aircraft have been destroyed. Casualties are severe, with over 2,400 personnel confirmed dead and more than 1,000 injured. The scale of the destruction is staggering, and the Pacific Fleet has been crippled. Immediate action is required. This is an act of war; we must respond decisively."

aga.2.desc:0 "Yesterday, December 7, 1941 — a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.The United States was at peace with that nation, and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific.Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American island of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. And, while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations. No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory."
