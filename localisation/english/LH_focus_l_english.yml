 HUN_meet_with_the_members_of_the_rongyos_garda_desc:0 "The Rongoys Gárda are a paramilitary group that are viewed by heroes by our population. Not only did they help secure the city of Sopron to stay a part of Hungary after the Great War, they were also active in countless other activities that benefited our nation. Ever since the mid-twenties, the group has disbanded, and in light of the recent developments, it is best to call them back together."

 HUN_work_with_the_turul_alliance_desc:0 "After the end of the great war Gyula Gömbös, together with the universities of Hungary, established a University Youth Organisation which spanned the whole country and has countless followers.

 HUN_openly_militarize_the_levente_movement_desc:0 "The Levente Movement is a youth Organisation that focuses on physical and health training and was founded in 1921. Originally supported by the M.O.V.E., we need to take over the organisation and use it for our own needs, by making the participation mandatory for all boys between the age of 12 and 16 and thus circumvent the conscription ban that the Treaty of Trianon imposes on us."

 HUN_renew_rome_protocols:0 "Renew the Rome Protocols"
 HUN_renew_rome_protocols_desc:0 "In light of Germany's continuing revisionism, we must renew the Rome Protocols drawn up and signed in 1934. The agreements would serve not only to further isolate the German and Yugoslavian threats, but also as a possible precursor to an actual alliance."

However, there are still some that still wont stand with us, mainly the social democrats (and the secret communists within them). It is up to [ROOT.GetLeader] to spend some time with the leading politicians of the other ideologies to convince them of our cause. Political differences need to be put aside in order to be a strong nation and achieve our common goal. \nLuckily for us, even though the population has very varied views and concepts, there is one thing everyone agrees on: The Revision of our borders.

It is clear that we will never return to the monarchy, which is why we shall announce a new era in our history. [ROOT.GetLeader] has officially gathered enough power and support to announce his "permanent regency" as we will call it.

We are ready and prepared to finally return the lands to their rightfull posessors: us. However, there is a problem: France is guaranteeing the independence of Romania.

 HUN_supply_honved:0 "Supply the Honvéd"
 HUN_supply_honved_desc:0 "The Honvéd are the hungarian part of the Austro-hungarian army. Since the origin of the second Austro-hungarian empire is of Hungarian nature, we should make the Honvéd the main part of the Army, whilst the Landwehr should just have a reserve and garrison function.

 HUN_exalt_tripartitum_desc:0 "István Werbőczy once wrote his Tripartitum, in which he pled the lower class nobles should have the same rights as the higher class nobles. He even suggested commoners to participate in the royal court. The Tripartitum therefore is a symbol of power to the people and reducing the kings powers, as both the nobility and the king receive their power from the Holy Crown of Hungary. Exalting the Tripartitum would mean we could keep the current way our ministers work, with the disadvantage that we have less control over them in the long run."

While this used to be a monarchical chivalric order established by king Sigismund of Hungary - and thus closely tied to the king - their modern interpretation has changed its core ideas. Initially, its main intention was to rally devout christians to defend their country against the muslim Ottomans. Today, the members of the Dragon Movement insist on bringing back old values and push for a government governed by a democratic system consisting of "tribal Hungarians" only. This idea has gotten a lot of public attention, and their number of followers is growning by the day."

Unfortunately, though winning the civil war, the communists are not the most popular politicians in the country, and by having a democratic election, the people would probably choose a different party to lead the nation. [ROOT.GetLeader] has come up with a new strategy which he calles Salami Tactics. This essentially means slowly but surely chipping away at the opposition, until there is no more opposition left. This divide and conquer tactics has proven very effective, and it is only logical to continue with it."

 HUN_the_red_news:0 "The Red News"
 HUN_the_red_news_desc:0 "The Red News was a propaganda tool by Béla Kun in 1919, which attempted to brainwash the population to support the governments views and expand hatred against capitalists, fascists and monarchists. This ingenious method had widespread success in the country and by reimplementing it into our everyday life of the present we will surely sway some more people to join our cause."
 HUN_hungarian_stalin:0 "Free Rákosi"
 HUN_hungarian_stalin_desc:0 "Mátyás Rákosi, a devout stalinist and fanatical follower of Stalin, has already been doing communism's bidding in the 1919 revolution. As one of the only ones surviving the following white terror, he was captured and imprisoned by the government of Horthy. His punishment should have been over in 1925, but the government "found" new evidence of crimes during the 1919 revolution and sentenced him to lifetime in prison.

 HUN_restart_the_red_terror_desc:0 "The Red Terror was mainly carried out by the Lenin Boys in 1919, killing many people on the countryside who were allegedly against the communist cause. This proved to be very effective, though it did lead to the population being very anti-communist in the following decade. In order to deal with the M.O.V.E however, we will have to utilize the Red Terror once more. It is only with fear that we can squash the threat of the right-wing."

 HUN_provincial_autonomy_desc:0 "The only way of really gaining the trust of our people and to convince them that they are stronger with us, is to give the states their autonomy. Not only would that help stabilize the country until we have found a permanent solution, but it would strengthen our bonds and show the population that everyone in our empire is equally cared for. We are strong together!"
 HUN_united_against_extremism:0 "United Front Against Extremism"
 HUN_united_against_extremism_desc:0 "We are surrounded by extremists on all sides: Fascists and Communists. While these two groups will surely fight eachother eventually, when the pot starts boiling, we should still consider defending our own territory as best as possible. A commission will be assembled and an army department of defense made so that we may never suffer a defeat from these monsters abroad."
 HUN_emergency_conscription:0 "Emergency Conscription"
 HUN_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "Though our government form does not allow for the raising of conscription laws, unless it is really vital for defense, the parliament has unanimously decided that these special times call for special measures. Therefore, we will raise the conscription to a higher level, with the explanation that our army needs to be prepared as best as possible in the event of an invasion."
 HUN_develop_the_empire:0 "Develop the Empire"
 HUN_develop_the_empire_desc:0 "Many parts of the empire are underdeveloped, especially the east. We shall start multiple construction projects to have new factories and homes built, to ensure the well-being of our population, as well as the industry. The railway network could also need some updating, which should be made a top priority in the list of construction plans."
 HUN_establish_imperial_diet:0 "Establish the Imperial Diet"
 HUN_establish_imperial_diet_desc:0 "The Imperial Diet is like the parliament, but a level higher. It will be the place where all the member states of our empire will be able to send their representatives to discuss empire-tier questions, such as currency, school system, research, etc. The head of the Diet is either the King himself, or the prime minister of the empire, depending on what constitution our king has chosen."

 HUN_karls_dream_desc:0 "If Karl would be here, he would rejoice with joy, as we can now finally proclaim our newly born empire. After many hardships and conflicts we can now finally achieve the dream that we have all wanted for a very long time. A great ceremony will be held in the capital, and [ROOT.GetLeader] will hold a speech for the masses, which will be broadcasted across all europe for everyone to see. This historical day will be remembered for the next few decades, filling our people's hearts with pride and giving them strength."
 HUN_connect_cisleithania_with_transleithania:0 "Connect Cis- with Transleithania"
 HUN_connect_cisleithania_with_transleithania_desc:0 "The railway lines between Cis- and Transleithania were severed after the end of WWI. This has now proven to be problematic, as it has caused a bottleneck between the two regions, resulting in various equipment and shipment delays. In order to function properly, we need to extend the railway network on the past border areas, where the kingdoms used to have their borders."
 HUN_join_the_industries:0 "Join the Companies"
 HUN_join_the_industries_desc:0 "With various nations being united under one, we have the difficult logistical work in organising the industry to unite them in one. One by one, we will connect and absorbe industrial companies with eachother, so that in the end there will be one or a few main companies in charge of different tasks."

 HUN_habsburg_poland_desc:0 "Karl Albrecht of Habsburg is a polish national hero. He fought in the great war and stood up for polish independence multiple times. He is known as an excellent military leader, and he would make for a perfect king. We should start spreading our influence outside of our own borders, and maybe one day we will achieve a Habsburg europe..."
 HUN_merge_with_poland:0 "Merge with Poland"
 HUN_merge_with_poland_desc:0 "Our friendship and help with putting a Habsburg on the throne was not for free. Does it matter which Habsburg sits on which throne? It might as well be [ROOT.GetLeader], rather than [POL.GetLeader]. We would be far stronger as a union, which is exactly what we are going to propose to them."
 HUN_brothers_in_arms:0 "Brothers in Arms"
 HUN_brothers_in_arms_desc:0 "Throughout most of Hungarian history, the Poles have been our allies and good friends. This friendship is deeply anchored within the people of [POL.GetNameDef] and [ROOT.GetNameDef], and we can use this to our advantage. With a Habsburg sitting on the Polish throne, we should send them an alliance offer."

 HUN_yug_eternal_friendship_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is one of the last nations that hasn't fallen into the hands of Russia or Germany. In order to secure our mutual independence, we will offer them an eternal friendship pact, which they will hopefully accept. Signing this pact will also mean that we give up our claims of Croatia. Vojvodina and West Bánát will still be a topic to discuss, but it can wait for now..."
 HUN_dissolve_the_national_assembly:0 "Dissolve the National Assembly"
 HUN_dissolve_the_national_assembly_desc:0 "A big step towards having a fascist unitarian Hungary is to dissolve the National Assembly and parliament. [ROOT.GetLeader] already has sufficient power to do so, but has only made use of it once in the past to call out new elections. This time, no new elections will be called out and [ROOT.GetLeader] will be given a dictatorial position."
 HUN_work_with_szalasi:0 "Collaborate with Szálasi"
 HUN_work_with_szalasi_desc:0 "Szálasi is a very prominent fascist, who has created his own identity of fascism. As our political enemies are getting more and more in numbers, it is only wise to approach Szálasi and offer him to merge the fascist parties in one, and giving him the place as state secretary. It is commonly know that he is very power-hungry and will therefore surely not refuse our offer."
 HUN_incorporate_the_move:0 "Incorporate the M.O.V.E"
 HUN_incorporate_the_move_desc:0 "The M.O.V.E has long been a pain in the back for the government, as it has caused a lot of chaos and destruction in the past. The only way forward is to officially incorporate the organisation into the government, and use it as our private militia to hunt down and harrass political enemies." 
 HUN_german_friendship:0 "German Friendship Treaty"
 HUN_german_friendship_desc:0 "Our government is already molded after the one in Germany, and we have more than a few causes to approach them as friends. We will offer them a friendship treaty, that will hopefully align us even further to them and win their trust. If we're lucky, this could be the first step to a longlasting friendship between our nations."

 HUN_the_move_convention_desc:0 "The first M.O.V.E Convention was held in Budapest on May 14th, 1930. It has been several years since and due to recent developments regarding the stability of the country the organisation is preparing for the second M.O.V.E Convention. Preparations have already begun, and the leaders of the movement hope to strengthen their leadership as well as gather new supporters, that can help bring the movement to new hights."
 HUN_join_anti_comintern_pact:0 "Sign the Anti-Comintern Pact"
 HUN_join_anti_comintern_pact_desc:0 "If we want the Germans to favour us more, it is best if we signed the Anti-Comintern pact. This would also make our position towards communism very clear; we do not accept anything related to the filthy communists, and if that means war against them, then so be it. By signing the pact, we will stand together once the great Purge against the communists begins."
 HUN_side_with_the_workers:0 "Support the Lower Classes"
 HUN_side_with_the_workers_desc:0 "The farmers and lower classes have the toughest toll; They are the one's that lost the most land with the installation of the Treaty of Trianon. Their voices are the one's gone unheard, but not much longer. Ferenc Szálasi has always been on the side of the lower classes and promised the return to the old ways, once the Revision of our former borders is complete."
 HUN_a_new_middle_class:0 "Support the Middle Class"
 HUN_a_new_middle_class_desc:0 "It is apparent, that the middle class is the the lifeblood of our nation. While the nobility is relaxing on their golden chairs and the farmers are doing the work necessary to keep the country running, it is the middle class that gets all the really important things done.

 HUN_SCYTHE_BOSZORMENY_desc:0 "In order to secure our power and keep our enemies at bay, we need to expand our organisation drastically. Luckily, our recent actions have helped our public image, and more and more politicians and members of the public are starting to see [HUN_prime_minister_name]s role as the saviour of our beloved country. We have received extensive funding through public money collections, which we should use to expand our Scythe Cross guard, who will carry out the "dirty work" for us. The goal is very near, so we shouldn't stop our efforts until we have reached our final destination."
 HUN_SCYTHE_SZALASI_desc:0 "The Scythe Cross Movement, lead by Zoltán Böszörmény has pitifully tried a coup and miserably failed. Yet Böszörmény's followers aren't willing to cooperate with other fascist movements. They are the only one's that managed to stay an independant movement. Not for much longer. Ferenc Szálasi will arrange for a meeting with Böszörmény, who is currently in exile in Germany, to persuade him to join our cause or get squashed under the boots of Hungarism."

 HUN_scythe_cross_supremacy_desc:0 "Our Movement has grown to gigantic proportions, and it is time to incorporate it into the national army. [HUN_prime_minister_name] has officially decided to personally oversee the army, and by adding our scythe cross guard into it, we will be unstoppable!"
 HUN_a_christian_state:0 "A Catholic State"
 HUN_a_christian_state_desc:0 "The Eucharistic Congress was a success and the state has made financial gains from it. With the earnings, we are now able to construct and open up new factories, which will not only boost our production, but higher the standards of living, proving to the people that the [HUN.GetFascistParty] is and will always be the right choice for the country."
 HUN_laissez_faire:0 "Adopt Laissez-Faire"
 HUN_laissez_faire_desc:0 "As Imrédy is a man of business, he has closely studied the various economic models of the world and has come to the conclusion, that the best concept for Hungary is the the french concept of Laissez-Faire. This concept intails, that the government does not interfere with the countries economy except for financial help here and there to get the gears going. By allowing this fairly liberal approach, our industry can recover quicker from the depression we are suffering."
 HUN_german_protection:0 "Seek German Protection"
 HUN_german_protection_desc:0 "The Germans are the only ones we can trust in nearly all matters. It is evident that their interests align with ours, which is why it is imperative that we seek a closer cooperation with them. If we really want to be successful, we can only hope to become a Reichskommissariat of the Germans, effectively making us their puppet. However, being we will negotiate as much freedom as possible, while enjoying all the benefits of the German economy. An envoy attaché will be sent to Berlin to discuss the future diplomacy between our countries."
 HUN_call_for_election:0 "Call for an Election"
 HUN_call_for_election_desc:0 "Imrédy is obsessed with winning his position 'fairly', which is why he insist on having an election to put him to power. The elections will be held 'secretly' and the middle class will receive full voting rights. Furthermore, the secret ballots will only contain the option to vote for Imrédy, or nobody. We will see what the results are..."
 HUN_meddle_for_support:0 "Rally Officers Support"
 HUN_meddle_for_support_desc:0 "Many of the officers are either devout supporters of [ROOT.GetLeader], or want to align with Germany. Unfortunately for us, this means that the vast majority of the high command would not be willing to join our rebellion. With a series of blackmails and other persuasive methods we will convince the generals to join our cause."
 HUN_pillage_for_supply:0 "Pillage for Supplies"
 HUN_pillage_for_supply_desc:0 "On July 30.th, 1920 the Rongyos Gárda robbed a supply depot in Fürstenfeld, Austria to then use the weapons to fight against the communist regime of Béla Kun. As we are yet again in a similar situation, desperate measures are needed to survive. The Rongyos Gárda will carry out further gun robberies just across the Hungarian border, which will hopefully be sufficient to supply our poorly equiped army."
 HUN_italian_weapons_imports:0 "Italian Weapon Imports"
 HUN_italian_weapons_imports_desc:0 "As we have clearly announced our leanings towards Italy, we should send a few members of the Gárda to Rome to negotiate weapon imports from Italy. Surely it is in the Italians best interest that our march to Budapest be as successful as possible."
 HUN_asassinate_political_enemies:0 "Assassinate Political Enemies"
 HUN_asassinate_political_enemies_desc:0 "Unfortunately, there are many in government that are and have always been strictly against the Rongyos Gárda, calling us 'terrorists'.

 HUN_march_on_capital:0 "March on the Capital"
 HUN_march_on_capital_desc:0 "Finally, the day has come. The people and the Gárda are ready to stand up and fight for a change in government.

 HUN_restructure_political_landscape:0 "Restructure the Political Landscape"
 HUN_restructure_political_landscape_desc:0 "With the situation finally in a stable position, we can now tend to the last remaining innerpolitical issue: The political landscape. Having fought this hard war we cannot allow opposition parties to get back their control. Therefore, parliament will be dismissed, and all former members will get the chance to choose their fate: Either they join our party, or they will face banishment or punishment by death. It is the only way to secure our political stability."
 HUN_pardon_political_extremists:0 "Pardon Political Extremists"
 HUN_pardon_political_extremists_desc:0 "Political Extremists - especially of fascist nature - have been banned and locked up in the previous decade. This has severely limited the effectiveness of fascist movements and caused them to splinter into many fractions. If we pardon these fascists and let them continue with their work, it will be easier to unite them later on, when the time is right."
 HUN_hungarian_life:0 "Hungarian Life Movement"
 HUN_hungarian_life_desc:0 "Imrédy's vision of a new Hungary has led to the idea of establishing his political concept of "Hungarian Life". It will encompass all of Imrédy's values to secure total control over the state and acts as a mirror to his own view on how a nationalist state should function. We will organise a speech for him in the Budapest Vigadó, inviting many influencial politicians and military advisors to the announcement of a new Hungarian life!"
 HUN_arrow_cross_deal:0 "A Deal with the Fascists"
 HUN_arrow_cross_deal_desc:0 "Kálmán Hubay has formed a new party together with Szálasi, and through the recent Anschluss of Austria we find ourselves bordering Germany. Therefore, [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s movement room has drastically been reduced and in order to stop the rights to get too much power, he will privately meet with Hubay and present him a deal which he will hopefully not decline. If [HUN_prime_minister_short] manages, it might lead to the fascists getting less of a problem, but it will come at a cost..."

 HUN_present_new_law_desc:0 "[HUN_prime_minister_name] has spent the last months working on an idea of his on how to change the course of our nation. He has drafted a new law that will help us do so and will present it in parliament soon. Apparently, it should give him more power, which would make the management of the country easier. [ROOT.GetLeader] hasn't made an official statement about this, but will probably take position about it once [HUN_prime_minister_short] announces the law."
 HUN_improve_western_relations:0 "Improve Relations with the West"
 HUN_improve_western_relations_desc:0 "Our relations with the West have deteriorated, and the fact that we have a new prime minister could be the perfect opportunity to turn the things to the better. England has never really had a good relation with us, but in light of events on continental europe, it might be prudent to get in contact with [ENG.GetLeader]. Who knows, it might be the spark that ignites a new friendship..."
 HUN_mem:0 "Hungarian Life Movement"
 HUN_mem_desc:0 "[HUN_prime_minister_name] has worked on the details of his new movement, which is supposed to bring the "miraculous revolution" within the country. Unfortunately, he has already gathered many followers and the head of the movement has reserved the Budapest Vigadó to announce the official formation of the group. [ROOT.GetLeader] is observing the situation with a watchful eye, ready to depose [HUN_prime_minister_short] if it should escalate..."
 HUN_ban_arrow_cross:0 "Imprison Szálasi"
 HUN_ban_arrow_cross_desc:0 "Ferenc Szálasi has caused far too much trouble in the country to be allowed to stay free any day longer. Ever since his first party, the NAP, was banned, he has had a dozen lawsuits on his neck. The lack of evidence has caused these lawsuits to be postponed long enough, and it is finally time to come to a concrete verdict: guilty. Once prime minister [HUN_prime_minister_short] and [ROOT.GetLeader] have signed the necessary papers, Szálasi - together with approximately 70 other members of his party - will be imprisoned for good."
 HUN_mission_to_germany:0 "Diplomatic Mission to Germany"
 HUN_mission_to_germany_desc:0 "It is clear that the only way forward for Hungary is together with Germany. Because of this, we should send a delegation to Germany to discuss the future of our two countries and to assure them that we are their friends, who they can trust in. Even if the conservatives and [ROOT.GetLeader] think otherwise, it is prudent to at least act as if we were interested in German cooperation. Furthermore, they offer us help with our revision and are willing to buy our products, so it is only logical to show them we appreciate their help."
 HUN_yug_friendship_treaty:0 "Eternal Friendship Treaty"
 HUN_yug_friendship_treaty_desc:0 "Yugoslavia is one of the last nations that hasn't fallen into the hands of Russia or Germany. In order to secure our mutual independence and good intentions, we will offer them an eternal friendship pact, which they will hopefully accept. The situation in europe is looking very dire, and just both our countries are very likely to become occupied, which is why this treaty is so important. It would also be a subtle hint to Germany that we are not willing to simply become their puppet any time soon."

 HUN_stabilize_country_desc:0 "[HUN_prime_minister_name] has compiled a series of possible projects within our country to improve the standard of living, as well as ease the re-integration of our recently annexed territories. The change in political management and with it together the milder approach has resulted in the stabilization of the country, though a few more things need to be done. [HUN_prime_minister_short] will try to stop further advances of the right-wing, and it seems our situation in the world is finally looking good. The funding for [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s projects have already been secured and all we need to do is let [HUN_prime_minister_short] lead the way."
 HUN_prepare_the_army:0 "Mobilize the Army"
 HUN_prepare_the_army_desc:0 "Our army is still very weak. Even though the Györi Program has done incredible work, we need to amp up our conscription, if we are to keep on track with our allies. Only by actively helping out with the war can we prove our worth to them and hopefully they will then allow us to stay independant after the war is won..."
 HUN_support_ss:0 "Support the Waffen-SS"
 HUN_support_ss_desc:0 "There are many Germans living in our country, and our high command is also full with hungarianized Germans. By allowing those, who feel like ethnic Germans join the German SS, we can rid ourselves of the German population in Hungary and also gain the favour of Germany."
 HUN_allow_left_wing_ministers:0 "Allow Leftist Ministers"
 HUN_allow_left_wing_ministers_desc:0 "In order to counter the very strong right-wing, prime minister [HUN_prime_minister_short] has decided to lift the ban on socialist and liberal parties, with the exception of the communist party. He will officially invite prominent members of the left scene to join parliament, which will hopefully be a good counterweight to the right extremists."
 HUN_peace_bureau:0 "Establish the Peace Bureau"
 HUN_peace_bureau_desc:0 "It is clear that Germany is not going to win the war. The tides have changed, and German arrogance has lead to them biting off more than they can chew. Switching the sides in the war should be our highest priority, as we cannot allow Hungary to fall under the hands of Russia or Germany. [ROOT.GetLeader]'s son Miklós will be tasked with creating the Peace Bureau to handle the tasks involved with changing the sides. We are sure he will do a great job."
 HUN_reorganisation_of_the_hungarian_army:0 "Reorganise the Army"
 HUN_reorganisation_of_the_hungarian_army_desc:0 "Now that we have the right to expand our military and the production of equipment, which was previously banned through the Treaty of Trianon, we need to reorganise the entire army to streamline chains of command and the way we choose and train our soldiers. In order to effectively carry out our will through force, we need a good structure, as well as motivated men and women, who will do anything to help the country achieve its goals."

 HUN_horthys_succession:0 "Horthy's Succession"
 HUN_horthys_succession_desc:0 "Our beloved regent [ROOT.GetLeader] is getting old, and has served his country for nearly 30 as regent and before that as an admiral for the Austro-Hungarian navy.

 HUN_hungarian_ss:0 "Establish the Hungarian SS"
 HUN_hungarian_ss_desc:0 "Rather than relying on a German-led group by the Volksbund, we should set up our own SS Divisions, mainly consisting of Hungarian soldiers, rather than German ones. We will task [HUN_jozsef_grassy.GetName] to set up the Divisions."

 HUN_ask_austria_for_help_desc:0 "Austria is already supporting our cause, having signed the Rome Protocols in 1934. Seeing that we are in a difficult situation, we could ask them to support us by sending a secret telegram to the Austrian parliament. If we are lucky, our enemy will have to fight a two front war, allowing us to gain control faster and ultimately align ourselves with Austria sooner than expected."

 HUN_get_rid_of_the_threat_desc:0 "It is very clear, that the Germans will not hold back with anything to secure their claims on the "Ostmark", their name for Austria. We cannot allow this to happen and therefore must strike the Germans before they strike us. However, this decision ultimately lies with the Austrians, but all we can do in the meantime is to prepare for war on that front."

 HUN_non_interference_with_germany_desc:0 "Though the Germans eagerly want to secure Austria for themselves, by doing so they would inevitable make enemies, that they cannot afford to have.

 HUN_reorganise_the_garda_desc:0 "The Rongyos Gárda was and still is a ragtag band of untrained soldiers.

 HUN_expand_the_garda:0 "Expand the Gárda"
 HUN_expand_the_garda_desc:0 "The Gárda started as a small group and has since grown considerably. However, the group still only consists of a few hundreds of official members.

 HUN_greek_alliance:0 "Greek Alliance" 
 HUN_greek_alliance_desc:0 "The Greeks already are cowering behind their lines awaiting an Italian invasion. If we were to reach a hand out to them and offer some territory, they would surely accept an offer to join our mighty alliance. Of course, this would also come with a redrawal of their borders in favour of our other members with claims, but this wouldn't come without reward for them... With the geographically practical placement, they could be very useful for our goals."
 HUN_alliance_with_romania:0 "Alliance with Romania"
 HUN_alliance_with_romania_desc:0 "The Romanians are already leaning towards an alliance with Germany. We cannot risk them falling into the German hands. War with Romania is inevitable, as we have our claims on Transylvania. However, we could accept a deal with us receiving Northern Romania and Bulgaria receiving Dobrudja in return for their entrance to our alliance, which would give them much more protection than the Axis."

 HUN_secure_the_supply_line_desc:0 "The Supply situation in Africa is dire. Our troops cannot fight in the harsh conditions of the continent if they do not have the supply needed.

 HUN_negotiate_our_reward_in_africa_desc:0 "Even though we are allied to [ITA.GetNameDef], our help in the african continent should be rewarded. [ITA.GetNameDef] is not doing the entire work and without us, the continent might have been lost completely. By now, it is well known that there is a tribe in Africa called the "Magyarabs", and we cannot neglect our duty to protect them by putting their inhabited area, as well as the surrounding area under our command.

 HUN_SCYTHE_SZALASI_ECONOMY_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] is fascinated by the Italian envisioning of Corporatism, which is why he has ordered to transition the state into such a model. By dividing society into different corporate groups that represent their status, we can maximise the efficiency of our economy."
 HUN_the_builders_of_the_nation:0 "The Builders of the Nation"
 HUN_the_builders_of_the_nation_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] stands for the nation. And the nation consists and is held up by the small people. These small people being the workers and farmers, who are working hard day after day. These Builders of the Nation, as [HUN_prime_minister_short] likes to call them need to be funded, and helped to the highest degree, because without them, the high ups are nothing."
 HUN_new_hungarians:0 "The New Hungarians"
 HUN_new_hungarians_desc:0 "Szálasi envisions the nation to be inhabited by what he calles the "New Hungarians". These are citizens with little sense of selfishness, helping others and being subservient to the concept of the nation. According to [ROOT.GetLeader], this natural egoism of the people can only be supressed by material well-being. We will increase the spending of consumer goods to facilitate this change."
 HUN_solve_the_monarchy_question:0 "Solve the Monarchy Question"
 HUN_solve_the_monarchy_question_desc:0 "With [ROOT.GetLeader] firmly in control of the country, the question of the monarchy has still not been solved. Some say that the country still is a kingdom, with [ROOT.GetLeader] being the regent. This issue needs to finally be adressed; there is still the option to crown a german king, driving us closer to [GER.GetNameDefDef]. However, there are still many that believe our country should be lead by a Habsburg..."
 HUN_cult_of_personality_szalasi:0 "Cult of Personality"
 HUN_cult_of_personality_szalasi_desc:0 "Our great leader is the only thing our country needs. The time of the monarchy ended in 1918, and since then we have managed without a king. Instead of a king, we have a glorious new leader, who will steer our country into a bright future, even if this means going through some hard times to get there. Every person in the country will have to read a copy of Ferenc Szálasis book, and it will be taught from elementary schools on."
 HUN_refuse_to_pay_debts:0 "Refuse to Pay our Debts"
 HUN_refuse_to_pay_debts_desc:0 "Our country is swimming in debts and there is no way we can make it out of it in time for the next conflict. We don't want to rely on another country for the help because that would bind us to it again. The world situation is tensed, and we could use this opportunity to simply decide not to pay our debts back. Szálasi has devised a plan of paying up to 20% of our debts, while the rest will go into the funding of the military. Of course this would damage our relations with most of the major nations of europe, but it is the necessary thing to do."
 HUN_split_yugoslavia:0 "Split Yugoslavia"
 HUN_split_yugoslavia_desc:0 "Our neighbours to the south have always been hostile towards us, ever since the creation of their state in 1918. Now that the winds have changed, they suddenly are behaving very friendly with the hopes of securing an alliance or at least protection. In [ROOT.GetLeader]'s opinion, the state should not have existed in the first place, which is clearly shown by the internal conflicts they have. The only way to solve this and achieve peace, while removing a potential threat is to have the country split into its seperate nationalities. We have already made contacts in the country and apparently the Croats are very eager to break away from their opressors. If we send them enough equipment and manpower, they will be able to join the fight!"
 HUN_greek_claims_szalasi:0 "Greek Claims"
 HUN_greek_claims_szalasi_desc:0 "The greeks have suffered similarly to us after the great war, having lost a lot of their ethnic territories to the turks. This is what unites us with them, as the turks have been our rival for many centuries. It is time we help our Aegean friends to right the wrongs of the past."
 HUN_turkish_expansion:0 "Turkish Expansionism"
 HUN_turkish_expansion_desc:0 "Our old allies have lost a lot from the Great War. Though we had great differences, the Ottoman Empire was a loyal ally to Austria-Hungary, and it is only logical to help them regain some lost land after securing an alliance with them."
 HUN_support_greater_bulgaria:0 "Prussia of the Balkans"
 HUN_support_greater_bulgaria_desc:0 "Just like the turks, the Bulgarians were loyal allies to us in the Great War. Being very similar but yet very different to the Russians, the Bulgarians can be fierce fighters and it should be our priority to give them back the territories they deserve. Of course, having Greece in the alliance presents us with a problem, as the Bulgarians lay claim to Greek lands, but we will surely be able to come to an agreement, should it be necessary."
 HUN_polish_brotherhood:0 "Polish Brotherhood"
 HUN_polish_brotherhood_desc:0 "The Poles have long been our brothers and friends. History showed us, that they are loyal allies, and the cultural ties between our countries have always been one of the strongest in europe. Having once been the dominant power in the east, the Poles are now in a very difficult situation, being sandwiched between two great powers. Maybe, if we join forces, we will be able to hold the enemies off. Polak, wegier, dwa bratanki!" 
 HUN_eliminate_the_threats:0 "Eliminate the Threats"
 HUN_eliminate_the_threats_desc:0 "Instead of waiting for the enemy to be prepared, we need to catch them off guard. With our newly secured alliance we estimate that we are strong enough to strike our enemies in a surprise attack, which should give us the necessary strategical advantage."
 HUN_polish_claims:0 "Polish Claims"
 HUN_polish_claims_desc:0 "The polish borders have shifted many many times in the past hundred years, which is why they have claims to various lands, especially to the east. If we want a united and strong polish ally, we need to secure these lands to make them stronger than ever!"
 HUN_restructure_foreign_office:0 "Restructure the Foreign Office"
 HUN_restructure_foreign_office_desc:0 "Having clearly declared our interests in uniting europe not under the Germans, but under us, we need to expand the foreign office and increase relations with our neighbours as soon as possible. Kálmán Ráttkay, a man who is loyal to our cause has great knowledge in this field and could lead this ambitious endeavour to unite the people and correct the borders that were falsely drawn in the past."
 HUN_invite_catholic_nations:0 "Invite Catholic Nations"
 HUN_invite_catholic_nations_desc:0 "With our succesful Eucharistic Congress, where we were able to significantly boost our relations with other catholic nations, it is now time to fulfill [ROOT.GetLeader]s great ambition to unite all catholics under one grand alliance. As our alliance already stands strong, it is only natural to invite all other catholic nations to it."
 HUN_the_pope_takes_control:0 "The Pope takes Control"
 HUN_the_pope_takes_control_desc:0 "With our alliance now basically complete, there is only one more vital thing left to do. The Pope's influence over europe has been in a steady decline ever since the dissolution of the once mighty papal states. We need to formally put the pope in charge of [ITA.GetNameDef], in order to secure the heavenly kingdom of God on earth."
 HUN_promote_catholicism_abroad:0 "Promote Falangism"
 HUN_promote_catholicism_abroad_desc:0 "The huge success of the Eucharistic Congress has changed [ROOT.GetLeader] in his ways and ideas.

 HUN_infiltrate_britain:0 "Contact the British Fascist Movement"
 HUN_infiltrate_britain_desc:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] has always had very good ties to [ENG.GetNameDef] and its conservative party. In addition, [ENG.GetFascistLeader] is an influencial friend of [ROOT.GetLeader], and it might be a good idea to get in contact with him and prepare a coup for him, after taking over power in [ENG.GetNameDef]."
 HUN_sway_mussolini:0 "Sway Mussolini"
 HUN_sway_mussolini_desc:0 "[ITA.GetLeader] is an easy target for manipulation. [GER.GetLeader] knows this as a fact too, and even if we have the same intensions, we still find ourselves at a race to get [ITA.GetNameDef] on our side. We should send an envoy to Rome and present our offer for closer cooperation, by invoking the recent Rome Protocols signed in 1934. In addition to this, [ITA.GetLeader] would probably be easier swayed, if the british have already pledged for us, since the mediterranean threat would be eliminated in [ITA.GetLeader]s eyes."
 HUN_blackshirt_coup:0 "Blackshirt Coup"
 HUN_blackshirt_coup_desc:0 "Support of [ENG.GetFascistLeader] has skyrocketed and it is now time to support him with taking over power in [ENG.GetName]. We will send a group of volunteers to fight in their war and enter an official alliance once [ENG.GetFascistLeader] has taken over control." 
 HUN_connationalism:0 "Connationalism"
 HUN_connationalism_desc:0 "Szálasi believes in the concept of Connationalism, which [GER.GetLeader] doesn't seem to understand. According to Szálasi, the support of nationalist movements within their historical territories and spheres of influence on the grounds of historical evidence of cultural dominance is the only way forward for the future of Europe."

 HUN_approach_yugoslavia:0 "Approach Yugoslavia"
 HUN_approach_yugoslavia_desc:0 "Yugoslavia holds our old homelands of Croatia. However, the Croatians have always been rebellious, even in the middle ages. After much consideration, [ROOT.GetLeader] has come to the conclusion that we will offer to renounce our claim on Croatia in exchange for closer cooperation and mutual assistance of our countries."
 HUN_claim_croatia:0 "Claim [CRO.GetNameDef]"
 HUN_claim_croatia_desc:0 "Since the middle ages, Croatia has been an integral part of the hungarian kingdom. [YUG.GetNameDef] is in a weak position, and we will present them with an ultimatum to transfer the territory, or we will take it by force."

 HUN_BULGARIA_PUPPET_NAME:0 "Bulgarian Puppet"
 HUN_BULGARIA_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "Bulgaria could be an important alliance in the Balkans, as they have also suffered from an unjust humiliation after the Great War, very similarly to us. In addition, their government is favourably similar to ours which gives all the more grounds for an alliance."
 HUN_BULGARIA_PUPPET_DESC:0 "Bulgaria plays a key role in [ROOT.GetLeader]s idea of Hungária, as it will be the protector of the balkan southern flank against the turks, who have always been the arch-nemesis of Hungary, ever since its invasion in the middle ages."
 HUN_claim_halics:0 "Claim Halics"
 HUN_claim_halics_desc:0 "The region of Halics - or also known as Stanislawow - is supposed to be a part of our great country, which has been in our party programe ever since the beginning of the 1930s. We will send a request to be given control of said territory."

 HUN_greek_ally:0 "[GRE.GetAdjective] Ally"
 HUN_greek_ally_desc:0 "Greece is another candidate for an unfairly treated country after the Great War. They received their independance during the Balkan wars, but they didn't gain all the territories that they were promised. We can facilitate that need for Revision by inviting them to our faction and offering them to help them in their revisionist goals."
 HUN_turkish_ally:0 "[TUR.GetAdjective] Ally"
 HUN_turkish_ally_desc:0 "As a main loser of the Great War, [TUR.GetNameDef] went through a hard time in the 20s. They have recovered since, but have lost a lot in the process. Szálasis idea of Connationalism can be perfectly projected onto this country, which is why we will propose an alliance.
 HUN_claim_romania:0 "Claim Romania"
 HUN_claim_romania_desc:0 "Romania has always been our arch-nemesis and now that we have proven to [GER.GetNameDef] that we can be the dominant leader of the Balkans, we will approach [GER.GetLeader] with the question of getting control over Romania."

 HUN_german_tanks_desc:0 "If anything, the [GER.GetAdjective] tanks have proven the entire world, that the effective use of these machines can very well win battles in the fastest ways possible.

 HUN_new_order:0 "The New Order"
 HUN_new_order_desc:0 "Europe is an unorganised heap of borders and we see it our job to correct the wrongs of the atrocities of the previous peace deals.
