 HUN_educational_reform_left_desc:0 "The enemy is working on deadly weaponry which we can only counter if our brightest minds continuously work on projects. In order to achieve that we must reform our educational system to further help bringing bright minds into the field of science."

 HUN_invite_baltics_left_desc:0 "Though the Baltic States are quite far away, they are connected to us through our polish ally.

 HUN_grant_general_amnesty:0 "Grant General Amnesty"
 HUN_grant_general_amnesty_desc:0 "The anti-communist policy of Horthy has resulted in a mass of communist prisoners all over the country.

 HUN_utilize_the_kadar_hussars_desc:0 "The Pufajkások, also commonly known as the Kádár Husszárs is a paramilitary organisation consisting of men loyal to János Kádár and his regime.

The name "Pufajkás" comes from their characteristic uniforms which usually is a russian style cotton jacket, which is called "pufajka"."
 HUN_expel_germans:0 "Deport German Nationalists"
 HUN_expel_germans_desc:0 "Many of the big landowners are of German origin. Our relation with the [GER.GetNameDef] has drastically fallen on the bad side, and many Hungarians of the lower class don't even have a place to sleep at night. The government has decided to expropriate every german citizen living in Hungary, and the land gained from this will be handed out to those who actually need it. While this will definitely decline the amount of men we can recruit in the army and greatly anger the [GER.GetAdjective], we believe it is worth the effort."
 HUN_privatize_the_press:0 "Privatise the Press"
 HUN_privatize_the_press_desc:0 "Currently, the government runs all matters regarding the national press.

 HUN_expand_voters_rights:0 "Expand Voters Rights"
 HUN_expand_voters_rights_desc:0 "The current voting system that was designed by István Bethlen is horrenously outdated. It not only discriminates against foreigners and women, but is also very strict on the age group that can vote. By loosening the voting requirements we can make sure that even those of the lowest classes can vote with the same weight as the wealthier ones. Only then can we really see what the people want: A liberal government."
 HUN_expand_the_agriculture_university:0 "Fund the Agriculture Institute"
 HUN_expand_the_agriculture_university_desc:0 "Imre Nagy is - next to being a politician - very interested in the field of agriculture and has spent a lot of his life dedicating the agriculture research.

It is only logical to award him the position as professor at the agriculture institute in Budapest."
 HUN_the_red_kingdom:0 "The Red Kingdom"
 HUN_the_red_kingdom_desc:0 "The borders of Greater Hungary are still deeply anchored in the hearts of the people. The events and downfall of the first communist government in 1919 was proof of the fact that the people cannot let go, despite our ideology being borderless. This time, we will offer the people the return to our old borders and more. This time, it is not about territories being brought back, but rather exporting the Communist thoughts to our neighbours to ensure a return to old borders."
 HUN_invite_greece_left_com:0 "Invite Greece"
 HUN_invite_greece_left_com_desc:0 "Similar to the Albanians, the Greek are cowering behind their mountains and are hoping that the Italians don't knock on their door demanding submission. We need to knock the door first to stop the fascists from gaining a flank on our southern borders."
 HUN_invite_albania_left_com:0 "Invite Albania"
 HUN_invite_albania_left_com_desc:0 "The Albanians are in a tough position. The Italians are waiting at their doorstep to take over power. Before the country falls into the hands of the Italians, we need to secure their allegiance through putting a government similar to ours at their head."
 HUN_federalise_the_states:0 "Federalise the States"
 HUN_federalise_the_states_desc:0 "Now that we have successfully exported our ideology to our neighbours and have them firmly in our grasps, it is time to federalise the countries to one superstructure, much like the [SOV.GetNameDef]. [ROOT.GetLeader] has served his purpose for the Hungarian people, but now the stage is much bigger than just the Hungarians. A Soviet council will be established, to properly represent all ethnicities within the Federation. [ROOT.GetLeader] will of course be the chairman."
 HUN_support_romanian_communism:0 "Support Romanian Communism"
 HUN_support_romanian_communism_desc:0 "Why attack a neighbour if we can get them on our side? Romania already has a very flexible foreign policy, allowing them to swiftly change the general ideology of parliament. We should use this to our advantage and invest in creating a bit of an ideological shift in their country. [ROM.GetCommunistLeader] will finally have the chance to lead Romania and link us up with our allies in the east without having us to sacrifice any precious Hungarian lives."
 HUN_cut_trade_with_west:0 "Severe Trade Ties with the West"
 HUN_cut_trade_with_west_desc:0 "In order to show our complete willingness and devotion to the right cause, we will cut all trade with the western, capitalist, fascist and monarchist nations and focus our import and export industry on the [SOV.GetNameDef]. This might hurt us a bit with ressources, but it is worth the cost if it means getting a most valuable ally."
 HUN_subsidize_factory_construction:0 "Subsidize Factory Construction"
 HUN_subsidize_factory_construction_desc:0 "The countryside already has enough farmers to support the needs of the nation. What we are lacking is heavy industry in the heart of Hungary, which could sustain the public consumer goods demands and help out the construction industry. We will fund vast industrial projects to bring the capital and its surroundings into proper shape."
 HUN_help_the_farmers:0 "Help the Farmers"
 HUN_help_the_farmers_desc:0 "Hungary is a nation of farming. Modernizing the capital with heavy industry is a long term goal, that cannot be reached in the next few years, which is why we shouldn't prioritize it. Instead, we need to connect the countryside and help the farmers if we want a bright future."
 HUN_encourage_heavy_industry:0 "Encourage Heavy Industry"
 HUN_encourage_heavy_industry_desc:0 "In order to secure enough working space for the proletariat, as well as boost our production, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s right hand Ernö Gerö has designed an extensive armament program to turn Hungary into a "country of iron and steel". As this would support the rebuilding of our army it is highly recommended to have this plan come to fruition."
 HUN_privatize_key_organizations:0 "Nationalise Key Institutions"
 HUN_privatize_key_organizations_desc:0 "With the help of Rákosi and his Red Guard, we can forcefully nationalise all institutions, giving us more power and control over the national industry and companies."
