 HUN_germany_trade_deal_monarch:0 "Trade Deal with Germany"
 HUN_germany_trade_deal_monarch_desc:0 "The benefits to our industry of increased trade relations with Germany are clear, and claims of potential over-reliance of our economy on the Germans are exaggerated. We will go ahead and sign an extensive trade agreement."
 HUN_german_friendship_treaty_monarch:0 "German Friendship Treaty"
 HUN_german_friendship_treaty_monarch_desc:0 "In order to fully align ourselves with the germans, we need to assure [GER.GetLeader] our good intentions and willingness for cooperation.

 HUN_joint_aluminium_mining_monarch:0 "Joint Aluminium Mining Company"
 HUN_joint_aluminium_mining_monarch_desc:0 "As aluminum is an integral part of the modern war industry, we could easily obtain support to expand the mines in the north of our country."
 HUN_join_axi_monarch:0 "Join the Axis"
 HUN_join_axi_monarch_desc:0 "As our economy is already so reliant on the Germans, it is only logical that we shall follow them in war. We will send them a request for formal entry into the Axis alliance."
 
 HUN_continue_klebelsberg_monarch:0 "Continue in Klebelsberger´s Footsteps"
 HUN_continue_klebelsberg_monarch_desc:0 "The former minister of culture during Bethlen's service, Dr. Kuno Klebelsbergerg, was a very influential person who worked hard in improving the education system aswell as Hungary's cultural sphere. Him and Bethlen where Hungary's most influencial statesmen and by continuing his work in these sectors and inspiring new minds we can greatly improve our research."
 HUN_visions_of_greater_hungary_monarch:0 "Visions of Greater Hungary"
 HUN_visions_of_greater_hungary_monarch_desc:0 "Everybody in Hungary agrees that the punishment by the great powers was far to harsh, and the hate for taking away two thirds of our former territory grows by the day. We can use these emotions to rally the whole nation behind us in order to put our entire strength into achieving the goal of the Revision. We may be weak and small now, but together we will reclaim all our lost land and in the end, WE will stand victorious!"

 HUN_ISTVAN_CORONATION_NAME:0 "Crown István Horthy"
 HUN_ISTVAN_CORONATION_DESC:0 "The young István has proven himself to be a great asset to the Hungarian nation. A very talented engineer and aviation hero, he has quickly conquered the hearts of the people. Additionally, he is a staunch anti-German, which might come in handy if we are planning on distancing ourselves from the German menace..."
 HUN_MIKLOS_CORONATION_NAME:0 "Crown Miklós Horthy"
 HUN_MIKLOS_CORONATION_DESC:0 "Miklós Horthy, our current regent, admiral of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, war hero and popular figurehead of our nation shall be the new king of Hungary.

 HUN_unite_the_country_monarch:0 "Unite the Country"
 HUN_unite_the_country_monarch_desc:0 "The recent election of a king for our nation has certainly assured stability in our nation. However, there are still some that still wont stand with us, mainly the social democrats (and the secret communists within them). It is up to [ROOT.GetLeader] to spend some time with the leading politicians of the other ideologies to convince them of our cause. Political differences need to be put aside in order to be a strong nation and achieve our common goal."

 HUN_FUND_WORKING_CLASS_NAME:0 "Fund the Working Class"
 HUN_FUND_WORKING_CLASS_DESC:0 "The working class has been neglected by the government for a long time. This has lead to many workers secretly being communists, believing it would bring them prosperity. We will extensively fund the working class with higher wages and cheaper housing to gain their trust and allegiance, while profiting of the higher working morale resulting by it."
 HUN_NEW_POLITICS_NAME:0 "[HUN_prime_minister_short]'s new Political Stance"
 HUN_NEW_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The previous prime minister's fall has only strengthened [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s legitimacy. He has prepared a speech, in which he will present his vision of the future of our country. The Germans are now bordering us and pose a serious threat to our sovereignty - but if we play our cards right, this might not have to be the case. The Parliament will be prepared and decorated, so that [HUN_prime_minister_short] can hold his speech as soon as possible and we can get to work."

 
 HUN_strengthen_the_regency_monarch:0 "Reinforce the Regency"
 HUN_strengthen_the_regency_monarch_desc:0 "Horthy Miklós has proven to everyone that he is perfectly capable of leading the nation without officially being king. We don't see why Hungary would need to return to a monarchy if Horthy's rule is completely sufficient. By neither being king, nor dictator he can carefully steer through the upcoming political chaos in europe without having to fully align to any side."
 HUN_announce_horthys_permanent_regency_monarch:0 "Solve the Monarchy Question"
 HUN_announce_horthys_permanent_regency_monarch_desc:0 "The throne of Hungary is still as empty as it was a decade ago, but our Regent [ROOT.GetLeader] nearly has the same powers as the king would have. Since him and his family are not catholic, and the Habsburgs cannot return, there is no other option than to keep the status quo, until a suitable successor has been found or Horthy's family converts. It might well be that one of his descendants will be a catholic, who will then be crowned king of Hungary, in which case we need to prepare the way for him..."
 HUN_consolidate_horthys_power_monarch:0 "Consolidate Horthy's Power"
 HUN_consolidate_horthys_power_monarch_desc:0 "Before we do anything else we need to focus on the obvious: There are plenty of the opinion that Hungary needs to restore the monarchy. We need to convince the population that we don't need a king in order to be a sovereign eastern european power. This unfortunately means that some of the monarchists might actually turn to other ideologies but we need to risk that."
 HUN_turani_vadaszok_monarch:0 "Turáni Vadászok"
 HUN_turani_vadaszok_monarch_desc:0 "Even though the Turáni Vadászok were initially formed by Gyula Gömbös, who clearly had fascist views and tried to align himself with Germany and Italy, the Organisation itself has stayed loyal to [ROOT.GetLeader] and his regime. Therefore, we can freely recruit new soldiers from them and even use them as Horthy's personal guard."
 HUN_the_hungarian_brothers_alliance_monarch:0 "The Hungarian Fraternal Community"
 HUN_the_hungarian_brothers_alliance_monarch_desc:0 "The roots of this movement can be traced back to 18th century Transylvania.

 HUN_renounce_trianon_monarch_desc:0 "The injustice forced upon our nation at the end of the Great War, ripping away two-thirds of our once-great nation's territory and population, rivals that of the disgrace visited upon Germany in the Treaty of Versailles, and it must be undone."

 HUN_demand_transylvan_monarch:0 "Demand Transylvania"
 HUN_demand_transylvan_monarch_desc:0 "From all the territories that we lost after the Great War, Transylvania hit us the hardest. We are ready and prepared to finally return the lands to their rightfull posessors: us. However, there is a problem: France is guaranteeing the independence of Romania. Attacking them would subsequently mean a war with both Romania and France. In order to avoid this, we can send a delegation to France and maybe we can come to an agreement on the Transylvanian question."
 HUN_demand_vojvodin_monarch:0 "Demand the Vojvodina"
 HUN_demand_vojvodin_monarch_desc:0 "The Vojvodina, or better know to us as Bácska, was taken from us and given to the newly created Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This territory is largely populated by hungarians, which is why we need to urge Yugoslavia to return these territories to their rightfull owners."
 HUN_demand_slovakia_monarch:0 "Demand Southern Slovakia"
 HUN_demand_slovakia_monarch_desc:0 "If we can regain our territories without bloodshed, so much the better. Czechoslovakia will be given an ultimatum demanding the transfer of our rightful lands."

 HUN_german_equipment_monarch:0 "Equipment Imports"
 HUN_german_equipment_monarch_desc:0 "Our industry completely relies on our trade partners knowledge and trade, and they have been paying us for our aluminum and wheat exports.

 HUN_joint_technology_research_company_monarch:0 "Joint Technology Research Company"
 HUN_joint_technology_research_company_monarch_desc:0 "We can greatly benefit from our allied friends. Why not create a jooint technology research company, so that none of us have the need to constantly ask for permission to use oneanother's technologies?"
 HUN_domestic_investments_monarch:0 "Domestic Investments"
 HUN_domestic_investments_monarch_desc:0 "Our trade partner has approached us with the offer to invest in our domestic industry, so that the hungarian government and industry can focus on other aspects.

 HUN_german_rocketry_monarch:0 "German Rocketry"
 HUN_german_rocketry_monarch_desc:0 "Reports have reached us that the Germans are currently researching a new type of rocket.

 HUN_szalasi_roppentyu_monarch_desc:0 "The Buzogányvető is a new anti tank design which aims for an easy to produce weapon that can counter Soviet tanks and armour.

 HUN_industrial_cooperation_monarch:0 "Industrial Cooperation"
 HUN_industrial_cooperation_monarch_desc:0 "After the initial domestic investments, we have been aproached with another offer for a "donation" to improve our military industry. We will definitely not say no to such a generous offer, and will get started in building new factories immediately. This however will come at a cost of increased political influence over us."
 HUN_german_airfield_investments_monarch:0 "German Airfield Investments"
 HUN_german_airfield_investments_monarch_desc:0 "Now that we are able to produce a large amount of planes, we also need the airports to facilitate the machines.

Therefore, we are very flexible with our members, as long as they are tribal-Hungarians. In order to gain the momentum we need to take over the reigns in the government, we should host a dinner in our headquarters and invite influencial politicians to it. We might be able to gain new allies..."
 HUN_end_prime_ministry:0 "End the Prime Ministry"
 HUN_end_prime_ministry_desc:0 "Ever since [ROOT.GetLeader] took the throne, our prime minister has been nothing but a puppet to the kings wishes. This brings up the question, why have a prime minister at all? By officially removing the post of prime minister from our government, our king can get more control over the politics in the nation, and is not subject to unnecessary extra work anymore. From now on, the kings word is the final word."
 HUN_a_western_approach:0 "A Western Approach"
 HUN_a_western_approach_desc:0 "The west has proven to be very efficient with their monarchies, while their government form also has significant popularity with the citizens. By adopting their parliamental approach on monarchy, we can assure that our king and his line will never be deposed or threatened in any way, while keeping the population in check. It would also allow us to align ourselves more with the western powers, as they are friendly to those who are similar to them. It is a win-win."
 HUN_hold_crown_council:0 "Call for a Crown Council Meeting"
 HUN_hold_crown_council_desc:0 "The Crown Council is a valuable tool to [ROOT.GetLeader], to make decisions that the public need not to know of, and to gain some insight in local politics, which might not be transparent at all times. We will call for the first meeting and see what our advisors tell us about the current situation in Hungary."
 HUN_the_kings_guard:0 "The King's Guard"
 HUN_the_kings_guard_desc:0 "Every king has his own guards, which is not just a way of protecting the near environment of the king, but also acts as intimidation to visitors or simply anit-monarchists. Over the hundreds of years, all Hungarian kings had their own kings guard, and this trend is to be found outside of Hungary, nearly everywhere in the world. We shall establish the Kings Guard, a paramilitary organisation aimed at the protection of our king, consisting of the very elite of the Honvéd."
 HUN_restructure_high_command:0 "Restructure High Command"
 HUN_restructure_high_command_desc:0 "The high command is far to right-winged. Most of our generals favour the Germans over the British, which is absolutely outrageous. By properly cleansing this scum from the high command, we can assure that no coups or any other sort of mutiny can happen within the army. In an emergency, it is the military that will save us, and having dirt in the cogs will only hinder our victory."
 HUN_land_reform_monarchy:0 "Land Reform"
 HUN_land_reform_monarchy_desc:0 "The land reform is one of the most important issues in Hungary, next to the Revision. Various prime ministers in the past have tried, but with little luck. Of course, it will never be possible to please everyone, but by properly enacting a land reform, we can ensure that the farmers and low classes have a chance of living a life. This could potentially lead to a better industry and GDP, as well as finally lowering the non-employment rate and making the gap between rich and poor smaller. As an extra benefit, the lower classes might support the monarchy and the government more."

 HUN_cure_the_sick_man_of_europe:0 "Cure the Sick Man of Europe"
 HUN_cure_the_sick_man_of_europe_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Ottoman empire, the Turks have been in decline. Though their situation has already been getting better, we should bury the grudges of the past and lend them a hand. If we were to invite them to our alliance, they could greatly benefit from it, just as we could use their help in our wars."
 HUN_reelect_parliament_monarch:0 "Dissolve the National Assembly"
 HUN_reelect_parliament_monarch_desc:0 "In 1920, when the country elected [ROOT.GetLeader], he was granted considerable political authority. Amongst others, the prerogatives to suspend the activity of the National Assembly for up to 30 days, as well as the right to appoint the prime minister. Prime Minister Gömbös is already in bad health and is suffering from the late stages of cancer. It is in our best interest to let him resign and appoint a prime minister that has more moderate views and let him form a new government."
 HUN_arrest_political_extremists_monarch:0 "Arrest Political Extremists"
 HUN_arrest_political_extremists_monarch_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the far-right is gaining more and more power by the day. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been trying to keep prime minister Gömbös in check, but extremist movements are nevertheless growing like weeds in every corner of society. This has come to a boiling point not long ago, where Böszörmény Zoltán tried to march to Budapest and take over the country with his "Kaszaskeresztes Párt". With its defeat, the strongest fascist party is now the NAP, or Nemzet Akaratának Pártja, which was founded in 1935 by the former officer Ferenc Szálasi and is clearly national socialist. The only way to contain this threat is if we arrest him, and ban the party itself. This might cause some uproar, but on the long term it will be worth it."
 HUN_assure_horthys_anglophile_intentions_monarch:0 "Assure Horthy's Anglophile Intensions"
 HUN_assure_horthys_anglophile_intentions_monarch_desc:0 "The Regent has been a great admirer of western values, particularly of the british one. As a naval commander himself, he is astonished by Britains naval success and tradition, as with the way they handle the monarchy. Not everything is of his liking though, but the British helped us in the early stages of the great depression, effectively saving our country from ruin. [ROOT.GetLeader] has asked for closer cooperation with the british government, and so we will send our envoys to work on good relations between our nations."
 HUN_expand_vitezi_rend_monarch:0 "Expand the Vitézi Rend"
 HUN_expand_vitezi_rend_monarch_desc:0 "The Vitézi Rend was established by our Regent more than a decade ago to honour those who bravely fought in the Great War, or who have ever since achieved great things for our country. By further expanding the order and organising more initiation ceremonys, we can ensure a big and loyal followership, giving us the possibility to reach into many parts of society through having order members everywhere. The stronger the Vitézi Rend is, the better for [ROOT.GetLeader], as he nominally has more influence in the country."
