Unfortunately for him, his group could never gain much influence due to its politics being very similar to the far more popular Gyula Gömbös. Wanting more power, he soon turned to Germany and became an agent of the RSHA (Reichssicherheitshauptamt), the secret police organisation lead by Reinhard Heydrich. His party is therefore closely tied to Gömbös's ideas, and has always politicized according to constitutional guidelines. Integrating his movement into ours could bring us much closer to Germany, as well as give us anti-partisan experts in government."

He actively employes jews in his estates, which has lead to him being relatively unpopular amongst the fascist groups. He is therefore in no position to decline our offer."

It is also the plan to errect a column of Archangel Gabriel, which will be an exact replica of the high altar of St. Peter's cathedral in Rome. Furthermore, the church would like two bell towers built behind the monument. \nFurthermore, many decorative elements within the city must be put up, such as small floral gardens, and lights on the main bridges.
